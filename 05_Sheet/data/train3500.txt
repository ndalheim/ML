E	"the spp81ded1 mutations were isolated as suppressors of a saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-mrna splicing mutation prp8-1 the spp81ded1 gene encodes a putative atp-dependent rna helicase while attempting to clone the wild-type spp81ded1 gene we isolated plasmids which were able to suppress the cold-sensitive growth defect of spp81 mutants these plasmids encoded a gene named dbp1 which mapped to chromosome xvi and not to the spp81ded1 locus on chromosome xv the cloned gene suppressed the defect of spp81ded1 mutants when present on both high and low copy-number plasmids but complemented spp81ded1 null mutants only when present on high copy-number plasmids in contrast to the spp81ded1 gene the dbp1 gene was not essential for cell viability the nucleotide sequence of the dbp1 gene revealed that it also encoded a putative atp-dependent rna helicase which showed considerable similarity at the amino acid level to the spp81ded1 protein"
E	"we isolated a cdna of 2001bp encoding the full-length precursor of flavoridin which is one of the four disintegrins in the venom of trimeresurus flavoviridis and analyzed the cdna nucleotide sequence the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame consisted of a pro-domain 190 residues a metalloproteinase domain 205 residues a spacer domain 18 residues and a disintegrin flavoridin domain 70 residues thus indicating that the flavoridin precursor belongs to the p-ii class of snake venom metalloproteinases the unknown metalloproteinase domain shared strong sequence similarity with hr2a 712 identity and h2-proteinase 741 identity a low molecular mass hemorrhagic metalloproteinase and a non-hemorrhagic metalloproteinase in the same snake venom respectively"
E	"arabidopsis thaliana t-dna transformants were screened for mutations affecting seed fatty acid composition a mutant line was found with reduced levels of linolenic acid 183 due to a t-dna insertion genomic dna flanking the t-dna insertion was used to obtain an arabidopsis cdna that encodes a polypeptide identified as a microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase by its complementation of the mutation analysis of lipid content in transgenic tissues demonstrated that this enzyme is limiting for 183 production in arabidopsis seeds and carrot hairy roots this cdna was used to isolate a related arabidopsis cdna whose mrna is accumulated to a much higher level in leaf tissue relative to root tissue this related cdna encodes a protein that is a homolog of the microsomal desaturase but has an n-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide and its gene maps to a position consistent with that of the arabidopsis fad d locus which controls plastid omega-3 desaturation these arabidopsis cdnas were used as hybridization probes to isolate cdnas encoding homologous proteins from developing seeds of soybean and rapeseed the high degree of sequence similarity between these sequences suggests that the omega-3 desaturases use a common enzyme mechanism"
E	"the 15697-nucleotide sequence of paracentrotus lividus mitochondrial dna is reported this genome codes for 2 rrnas 22 trnas and 12 mrnas which specify 13 subunits of the mitochondrial inner membrane respiratory complexes the gene arrangement differs from that of other animal species the two ribosomal genes 16 s and 12 s are separated by a stretch of about 33 kilobase pairs which contains the nd1 and nd2 genes and a cluster of 15 trna genes the nd4l coding sequence is not contained in the nd4 mrna but has its own mrna which maps between the trnaarg and the co ii genes the main noncoding region located in the trna gene cluster is only 132 nucleotides long but contains sequences homologous to the mammalian displacement loop other short noncoding sequences are interspersed in the genome they contain a conserved at consensus which probably has a role in transcription or rna processing as regards the mitochondrial genetic code the codons aga and agg specify serine and are recognized by a trna with a gcu anticodon whereas aua and aaa code for isoleucine and asparagine rather than for methionine and lysine except for nd4l which starts with auc and atpase 8 which starts with gug aug is used as the initiation codon in 11 out of 13 cases the genes terminate with the canonical stop codons uaa or uag these observations suggest that during invertebrate evolution each lineage developed its own mechanism of mitochondrial dna replication and transcription and of rna processing and translation"

B	"binding of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pak to mucin has been shown to be mediated by the flagellar cap protein product of the flid gene since the flagellar cap is very likely an exposed structure the flid polypeptide should be recognized by the host immune system analogous to the recognition of dominant epitopes located in the exposed parts of the flagellin polypeptide within the assembled flagellum in p aeruginosa a number of distinct flagellin variants are made and these variable sequences presumably allow the newly infected p aeruginosa to escape recognition by the antibody induced during a previous infection since similar mechanisms may direct the selection of flid variants we examined the extent of sequence heterogeneity among various flid sequences among a selected group of p aeruginosa the results of pcr and nucleotide sequencing of the flid region of eight different p aeruginosa strains laboratory strains pak pao1 and pa103 clinical strains 1244 cs2 and cs32 cystic fibrosis strains cs29 and mdr suggested that there were two distinct types of flid in p aeruginosa which we named a type and b type the results of western blotting using the polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified flid of a type pak or b type pao1 further confirmed the existence of two distinct antigenic types of flid proteins with no cross-reactivity between the two serotypes further western immunoblot analysis of the same strains using polyclonal flic antibody showed that the strains with a-type flid possessed a-type flic and those with b-type flid had b-type flic similar western blot analyses of 50 more p aeruginosa strains obtained from varied sources revealed that all strains contained either a-type or b-type flid suggesting the existence of only two types of flid in p aeruginosa and indicating that flic and flid were coinherited this limited diversity of flic and flid serotypes seems to be a unique feature of flagellar proteins a chromosomal mutant having an insertion in the flid gene of p aeruginosa pao1 was constructed the motility defect of this mutant and a previously constructed pak flid mutant was better complemented with the flid gene of the homologous types"
E	"the dermatophyte fungus trichophyton exhibits unique immunologic properties by its ability to cause both immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity an 83-kda trichophyton tonsurans allergen tri t 4 was previously shown to elicit distinct t lymphocyte cytokine profiles in vitro the homologous protein tri r 4 was cloned from a trichophyton rubrum cdna library and the recombinant protein was expressed in pichia pastoris this 726-amino acid protein contained an arrangement of catalytic triad residues characteristic of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteinases ser-asp-his in addition a novel trichophyton allergen encoding 412 amino acids was identified by its human ige antibody-binding activity sequence similarity searches showed that this allergen designated tri r 2 contained all of the conserved residues characteristic of the class d subtilase subfamily 41-58 overall sequence identity forty-two percent of subjects with immediate hypersensitivity skin test reactions to a trichophyton extract exhibited ige antibody binding to a recombinant glutathione s-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 289 amino acids of tri r 2 furthermore this antigen was capable of inducing delayed type hypersensitivity skin test reactions our results define two distinct antigens derived from the dermatophyte trichophyton that serve as targets for diverse immune responses in humans"
B	"methicillin-resistance of saureus mrsa was diminished or depressed at 44 degrees c in order to investigate whether bacterial heat shock response is correlated with methicillin resistance we examined the inducibility of the heat shock proteins hsps in mrsa and cloned and sequenced of their genes a temperature shift from 37 degrees c to 46 degrees c enhanced the production of at least 8 kinds of cytoplasmic proteins as measured with two-dimensional page the induced protein profile was almost the same as methicillin sensitive saureus and stress conditions due to ethanol cadmium or low ph two of these proteins were hsp60 and hsp10 their n-terminal amino acid sequences were 79 and 83 homologous with thermobacterium ps3 respectively a positively hybridized 42 kbp dna fragment encoding both proteins was isolated from the chromosomal dna of mrsa the resulting sequence revealed two reading frames and showed high homology to those of hsp60 groel and hsp10 groes of bacteria ecoli and several other species the genes of hsp60 and hsp10 in saureus comprised an operon as in ecoli the relationship between those hsps and pbp2' is currently under investigation"
B	"bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria"

B	"the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance"
E	"in order to understand the molecular mechanism of ouabain resistance in the toad bufo marinus nak-atpase alpha and beta subunits have been cloned and their functional properties tested in the xenopus laevis oocyte expression system according to sequence comparison between species alpha 1 beta 1 and beta 3 isoforms were identified in a clonal toad urinary bladder cell line tbm 18-23 the sequence of the alpha 1 isoform is characterized by two positively charged amino acids arg lys at the n-terminal border of the h1-h2 extracellular loop and no charged amino acid at the c terminus a pattern distinct from the ouabain-resistant rat alpha 1 isoform the coexpression of alpha 1 beta 1 or alpha 1 beta 3 tbm subunits in the xenopus oocyte resulted in the expression of identical maximum nak-pump currents with identical inhibition constant for ouabain ki alpha 1 beta 1 53 - 3 microm n  7 vs alpha 1 beta 3 57 - 30 microm n  8 but distinct potassium half activation constant k12 alpha 1 beta 1 087 - 008 mm n  16 alpha 1 beta 3 129 - 007 mm n  17 p less than 0005 we conclude that i the tbm alpha 1 isoform is necessary and sufficient to confer the ouabain resistant phenotype ii the beta 3 or beta 1 subunit can associate with the alpha 1 equally well without affecting the ouabain-resistant phenotype iii some specific sequence of the beta subunit can modulate the activation of the nak-pump by extracellular potassium ions"

E	"the fungal pathogen ustilago maydis exhibits a dimorphic switch from budding to filamentous growth in response to mating interactions and environmental conditions we have found that disruption of the uac1 gene encoding adenylate cyclase results in a constitutively filamentous phenotype budding is restored to the uac1 mutant upon growth in the presence of camp or by extragenic suppression because of a mutation in the ubc1 gene the ubc1 gene encodes a type ii regulatory subunit of camp-dependent protein kinase pka defects in this gene attenuate the filamentous growth that normally occurs in response to mating and exposure to air growth of wild-type cells in camp and mutation of the ubc1 gene also cause defects in the separation of mother and daughter cells cytokinesis and alter bud site selection these results indicate a key role for camp and pka in morphogenesis in u maydis this role may be common among dimorphic fungal pathogens"
E	"the mouse mb-1 gene was originally identified based on its restricted expression in b lineage cells predicted structural homology with the gamma chain of the cd3 complex on t cells led to the suggestion that the mb-1 protein might associate with surface igsig on b cells and be involved in signal transduction other studies identified at least two proteins that are noncovalently associated with sigm one of which has recently been shown to be the product of the mb-1 gene to identify genes specifically expressed in normal human b cells we constructed a b minus t lymphocyte subtraction library and isolated a cdna clone highly homologous to murine mb-1 m-mb-1 a full-length cdna was subsequently isolated and found to encode a membrane glycoprotein of 226 amino acids it included a leader sequence 32 amino acids an extracytoplasmic domain 111 amino acids containing six potential n-glycosylation sites and three cysteine residues for potential inter- or intrachain disulfide linkages a transmembrane domain 22 amino acids and an intracytoplasmic domain 61 amino acids the amino acid sequence homology between human and mouse mb-1 was especially striking approximately 92 in the intracytoplasmic transmembrane and membrane-proximal extracellular domains but was less marked approximately 42 in the remaining extracytoplasmic portion interestingly part of the 3'-untranslated region was also highly conserved between species suggesting an important role for this region in the regulation of mb-1 expression the human mb-1 h-mb-1 cdna hybridized with a mrna species of approximately 12 kb on northern blots similar to m-mb-1 the h-mb-1 transcripts could be detected in pre-b cell lines and fetal bone marrow in normal mitogen activated- and transformed b cells but not in myeloma plasma cells h-mb-1 was not expressed in peripheral t cells nor by cells of other hemopoietic lineages or in brain heart muscle lung and kidney surprisingly however low levels of h-mb-1 transcripts were detectable in two early t lineage cell lines and in the fetal thymus this suggests that mb-1 may have other functions in addition to its role in signal transduction in b lineage cells"
E	"cytochrome c oxidase cox is a 13-subunit protein complex that catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial electron transfer in mammals of the 10 subunits encoded by nuclear dna three are mtdna products some are expressed as tissue- andor development-specific isoforms for cox subunit viii previous work showed that expression of the contractile muscle-specific isoform gene cox8h is absent in humans and old world monkeys and the other isoform gene cox8l is expressed ubiquitously here we show that cox8h is transcribed in most primate clades but its expression is absent in catarrhines that is in old world monkeys and hominids apes including humans having become a pseudogene in the stem of the catarrhines the ubiquitously expressed isoform cox8l underwent nonsynonymous rate acceleration and elevation in the ratio of nonsynonymoussynonymous changes in the stem of anthropoid primates new world monkeys and catarrhines possibly setting the stage for loss of the heart-type h isoform the most rapidly evolving region of viii-l is one that interacts with cox i suggesting that the changes are functionally coadaptive because accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in anthropoids such as observed for cox8l are also shown by genes for at least 13 other electron transport chain components these encoded amino acid replacements may be viewed as part of a series of coadaptive changes that optimized the anthropoid biochemical machinery for aerobic energy metabolism we argue that these changes were linked to the evolution of an expanded neocortex in anthropoid primates"
B	"helicobacter pylori is one of the most common human pathogens it causes chronic gastritis and is involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcer disease and possibly gastric carcinoma helicobacter mustelae is a bacterium closely related to h pylori that causes gastritis and ulcer disease in ferrets and is therefore considered an important animal model of gastric helicobacter infections motility even in a viscous environment is conferred to the bacteria by several sheathed flagella and is regarded as one of their principal virulence factors the flagellar filament of h pylori consists of two different flagellin species expressed in different amounts the gene flaa encoding the major flagellin has recently been cloned and sequenced here we report the cloning and sequencing of two highly homologous new flagellin genes from h pylori 85p and h mustelae nctc 12032 the nucleotide sequence of the h pylori gene proved that it encoded the second flagellin molecule found in h pylori flagellar filaments the genes were named flab the h mustelae and h pylori flab genes both coded for proteins with 514 amino acids and molecular masses of 540 and 539 kda respectively the proteins shared 817 identical amino acids the degree of conservation between h pylori flab and the h pylori flaa major flagellin was much lower 58 both flab genes were preceded by sigma 54-like promoter sequences mapping of the transcription start site for the h pylori flab gene by a primer extension experiment confirmed the functional activity of the sigma 54 promoter to evaluate the importance of both genes for motility flaa- and flab-disrupted mutants of h pylori n6 were constructed by electroporation-mediated allelic exchange and characterized by western blot immunoblot analysis and motility testing both mutations selectively abolished the expression of the targeted gene without affecting the synthesis of the other flagellin molecule whereas flaa mutants were completely nonmotile flab mutants retained motility"

B	"in bacillus subtilis the adaptive response to dna alkylation depends on the ada operon which consists of the adaa and adab genes which encode methylphosphotriester dna methyltransferase adaa protein and o6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase adab protein respectively a structural gene alka that encodes 3-methyladenine dna glycosylase was found upstream of the ada operon but in the opposite orientation this cluster of genes was mapped at about 235 kb from the sfii recognition site near the origin of replication in the physical map of the b subtilis chromosome disruption of the alka gene sensitized cells to n-propyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine while its overproduction rendered cells highly resistant to n-propyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine indicating that lethal dna damage produced by bulky alkylating agents was effectively counteracted by alka glycosylase transcription of the alka gene was induced by treating adaa cells with methylating agents concurrent with transcription of the ada operon this was accomplished by using methylated adaa protein bound to a 30-bp segment in the middle of the 100-bp sequence between the transcriptional start sites of the alka gene and ada operon thus in this organism the adaptive response to dna alkylation is achieved by autologous activation of a divergent regulon composed of the genes for a dna glycosylase and two species of dna alkyltransferase"
E	"translation termination in eukaryotes requires a codon-specific class-i release factor erf1 and a gtpgdp-dependent class-ii release factor erf3 the model of molecular mimicry between release factors and trna predicts that erf1 mimics trna to read the stop codon and that erf3 mimics elongation factor ef-tu to bring erf1 to the a site of the ribosome for termination of protein synthesis in this study we set up three systems in vitro affinity binding a yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro competition assay to determine the erf3-binding site of erf1 using the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins and creating systematic deletions in erf1 the in vitro affinity binding experiments demonstrated that the predicted trna-mimicry truncation of erf1 sup45 forms a stable complex with erf3 sup35 all three test systems revealed that the most critical binding site is located at the c-terminal region of erf1 which is conserved among eukaryotic erf1s and rich in acidic amino acids to our surprise however the c-terminal deletion erf1 seems to be sufficient for cell viability in spite of the severe defect in erf3 binding when expressed in a temperature-sensitive sup45 mutant of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae these results cannot be accounted for by the simple erf3-ef-tu mimicry model but may provide new insight into the erf3 function for translation termination in eukaryotes"

B	"visual inspection showed clear evidence of a history of intraspecies recombinational exchanges within the neighbouring meningococcal shikimate dehydrogenase aroe and glutamine synthetase glna genes which was supported by the non-congruence of the trees constructed from the sequences of these genes from different meningococcal strains and by statistical tests for mosaic structure many examples were also found of highly localized interspecies recombinational exchanges between the meningococcal aroe and glna genes and those of commensal neisseria species these exchanges appear to have inflated the sequence variation at these loci and have resulted in major distortions of the phylogenetic trees constructed from the sequences of the aroe and glna genes of human pathogenic and commensal neisseria species statistical tests for sequence mosaicism and for anomalies within the neisseria species trees strongly supported the view that frequent interspecies recombination has occurred within aroe and glna the high levels of sequence variation and intra- and interspecies recombination within aroe and glna did not appear to be due to a 'hitch-hiking' effect caused by positive selection for variation at a neighbouring gene our results suggest that interspecies recombinational exchanges with commensal neisseria occur frequently in some meningococcal 'housekeeping' genes as they can be observed readily even when there appears to be no obvious selection for the recombinant phenotypes"

E	"cytochrome c oxidase cox is a 13-subunit protein complex that catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial electron transfer in mammals of the 10 subunits encoded by nuclear dna three are mtdna products some are expressed as tissue- andor development-specific isoforms for cox subunit viii previous work showed that expression of the contractile muscle-specific isoform gene cox8h is absent in humans and old world monkeys and the other isoform gene cox8l is expressed ubiquitously here we show that cox8h is transcribed in most primate clades but its expression is absent in catarrhines that is in old world monkeys and hominids apes including humans having become a pseudogene in the stem of the catarrhines the ubiquitously expressed isoform cox8l underwent nonsynonymous rate acceleration and elevation in the ratio of nonsynonymoussynonymous changes in the stem of anthropoid primates new world monkeys and catarrhines possibly setting the stage for loss of the heart-type h isoform the most rapidly evolving region of viii-l is one that interacts with cox i suggesting that the changes are functionally coadaptive because accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in anthropoids such as observed for cox8l are also shown by genes for at least 13 other electron transport chain components these encoded amino acid replacements may be viewed as part of a series of coadaptive changes that optimized the anthropoid biochemical machinery for aerobic energy metabolism we argue that these changes were linked to the evolution of an expanded neocortex in anthropoid primates"

E	"the aim of the present study is to understand the structural features responsible for the lethal activity of snake venom cardiotoxins comparison of the lethal potency of the five cardiotoxin isoforms isolated from the venom of taiwan cobra naja naja atra reveals that the lethal potency of ctx i and ctx v are about twice of that exhibited by ctx ii ctx iii and ctx iv in the present study the solution structure of ctx v has been determined at high resolution using multidimensional proton nmr spectroscopy and dynamical simulated annealing techniques comparison of the high resolution solution structures of ctx v with that of ctx iv reveals that the secondary structural elements in both the toxin isoforms consist of a triple and double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet domains critical examination of the three-dimensional structure of ctx v shows that the residues at the tip of loop iii form a distinct finger-shaped projection comprising of nonpolar residues the occurrence of the nonpolar finger-shaped projection leads to the formation of a prominent cleft between the residues located at the tip of loops ii and iii interestingly the occurrence of a backbone hydrogen bonding val27co to leu48nh in ctx iv is found to distort the finger-shaped projection and consequently diminish the cleft formation at the tip of loops ii and iii comparison of the solution structures and lethal potencies of other cardiotoxin isoforms isolated from the taiwan cobra naja naja atra venom shows that a strong correlation exists between the lethal potency and occurrence of the nonpolar finger-shaped projection at the tip of loop iii critical analysis of the structures of the various ctx isoforms from the taiwan cobra suggest that the degree of exposure of the cationic charge to the solvent contributed by the invariant lysine residue at position 44 on the convex side of the ctx molecules could be another crucial factor governing their lethal potency"

E	"an essential component of functional genomics studies is the sequence of dna expressed in tissues of interest to provide a resource of bovine-specific expressed sequence data and facilitate this powerful approach in cattle research four normalized cdna libraries were produced and arrayed for high-throughput sequencing the libraries were made with rna pooled from multiple tissues to increase efficiency of normalization and maximize the number of independent genes for which sequence data were obtained target tissues included those with highest likelihood to have impact on production parameters of animal health growth reproductive efficiency and carcass merit success of normalization and inter- and intralibrary redundancy were assessed by collecting 6000-23000 sequences from each of the libraries 68520 total sequences deposited in genbank sequence comparison and assembly of these sequences was performed in combination with 56500 other bovine est sequences present in the genbank dbest database to construct a cattle gene index available from the institute for genomic research at httpwwwtigrorgtdbtgishtml the 124381 bovine ests present in genbank at the time of the analysis form 16740 assemblies that are listed and annotated on the web site analysis of individual library sequence data indicates that the pooled-tissue approach was highly effective in preparing libraries for efficient deep sequencing"
E	"mouse beta 2-microglobulin beta 2m is polymorphic sequences of five allelic wild mouse b2m genes have been determined from the large exons of genomic dna using the polymerase chain reaction relative to the standard b2ma allele the products of four alleles of mus musculus origin w2 w3 w4 and w5 differ by only one or two amino acids w5 has a single nucleotide change asp85--val and is identical to the c allele w3 has two changes val-13--ile and lys44--glu w2 differs at arg81--thr and w4 at his34--gln and they share the asp85--val change with b2mc and b2mw5 w5 and c cells are lysed by s198 a monoclonal antibody specific for beta 2mb ala85 in a complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay whereas w4 cells are not thus distant changes appear to introduce subtle conformational effects on beta 2m structure five independent isolates of mus spretus w1 differ the most from b2ma with 12 amino acid changes and only one silent substitution replacements predicted from the nucleotide sequence occur in loops of the molecule facing away from the class i heavy chain and not in regions where beta 2m associates with class i alpha 3 domains concordantly the w1-5 allelic forms of beta 2m associate well with h-2 heavy chains the many amino acid changes in the spretus sequence and the paucity of silent substitutions suggest that b2m has been subject to positive selection"
E	"as a base for human transcriptome and functional genomics we created the full-length long japan flj collection of sequenced human cdnas we determined the entire sequence of 21243 selected clones and found that 14490 cdnas 10897 clusters were unique to the flj collection about half of them 5416 seemed to be protein-coding of those 1999 clusters had not been predicted by computational methods the distribution of gc content of nonpredicted cdnas had a peak at approximately 58 compared with a peak at approximately 42for predicted cdnas thus there seems to be a slight bias against gc-rich transcripts in current gene prediction procedures the rest of the cdnas unique to the flj collection 5481 contained no obvious open reading frames orfs and thus are candidate noncoding rnas about one-fourth of them 1378 showed a clear pattern of splicing the distribution of gc content of noncoding cdnas was narrow and had a peak at approximately 42 relatively low compared with that of protein-coding cdnas"

B	"the escherichia coli entd gene encodes a product necessary for the synthesis of the iron-chelating and transport molecule enterobactin ent cells harbouring entd mutations fail to grow in iron-deficient environments for unknown reasons it has not been possible to identify the entd product the nucleotide sequence of the entd region has now been determined an open reading frame extending in the same direction as the adjacent fepa gene and capable of encoding an approximately 24 kda polypeptide was found it contained a high percentage of rare codons and two possible translational start sites complementation data suggested that entd proteins truncated at the carboxy terminus retain some activity two rep sequences were present upstream of entd and an is186 sequence was observed downstream rna dot-blot hybridizations demonstrated that entd is transcribed from the strand predicted by the sequencing results an entd-lacz recombinant plasmid was constructed and shown to express low amounts of a fusion protein of the anticipated size approximately 125 kda the evidence suggests a number of possible explanations for difficulties in detecting the entd product sequence data indicate that if entd has its own promoter it is weak the rep sequences suggest that entd mrna may be destabilized and translation may be slow because of the frequency of rare codons and a possible unusual start codon uug the data are also consistent with previous evidence that the entd product is unstable"
E	"the dgcr6 digeorge critical region gene encodes a putative protein with sequence similarity to gonadal gdl a drosophila melanogaster gene of unknown function we mapped the dgcr6 gene to chromosome 22q11 within a low copy repeat termed sc111a and identified a second copy of the gene dgcr6l within the duplicate locus termed sc111b both sc111 repeats are deleted in most persons with velo-cardio-facial syndromedigeorge syndrome vcfsdgs and they map immediately adjacent and internal to the low copy repeats termed lcr22 that mediate the deletions associated with vcfsdgs we sequenced genomic clones from both loci and determined that the putative initiator methionine is located further upstream than originally described but in a position similar to the mouse and chicken orthologs dgcr6l encodes a highly homologous functional copy of dgcr6 with some base changes rendering amino acid differences expression studies of the two genes indicate that both genes are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues evolutionary studies using fish mapping in several different species of ape combined with sequence analysis of dgcr6 in a number of different primate species indicate that the duplication is at least 12 million years old and may date back to before the divergence of catarrhines from platyrrhines 35 mya these data suggest that there has been selective evolutionary pressure toward the functional maintenance of both paralogs interestingly a full-length herv-k provirus integrated into the sc111a locus after the divergence of chimpanzees and humans"

B	"n-terminal formylation of ribosome-synthesized polypeptides is assumed to be among the most conserved features that distinguish the eubacterial line of descent from other living phyla in order to assess the ancientness of this trait def genes encoding polypeptide deformylase were characterized from four eubacterial species lactococcus lactis bacillus subtilis calothrix pcc7601 and thermotoga maritima taking advantage of the conditional viability of the def mutants of escherichia coli altogether eight sequences of polypeptide deformylase have been obtained from all the eubacterial sources which were investigated either through systematic genome sequence analysis or through genetic screening yielding a highly homologous family a gene putatively encoding met-trnai formyltransferase fmt was found downstream of the deformylase gene except in l lactis mycoplasma genitalium calothrix pcc7601 and t maritima these results argue strongly for the ancestral character of n-terminal formylation in eubacteria most of the wide deviations of amino acid usage observed in def- and fmt-encoded proteins among species is best accounted for by the nucleotide composition of genomes furthermore the species of origin of each protein appears to be more recognizable than its function considering only its amino acid composition"
E	"activin is a member of the transforming growth factor beta tgf-beta and possesses various activities in cellular control phenomena during xenopus embryonic development activin is thought to act as a natural mesoderm-inducing factor we isolated here the xenopus activin receptor cdna from xenopus tadpole cdna library and examined the expression of the xenopus activin receptor gene during the course of early embryonic development the xenopus activin receptor has an 87 homology at the level of deduced amino acid sequence with the mouse activin receptor and using the cdna obtained three bands of mrna with different lengths were detected in xenopus embryos throughout early embryogenesis we synthesized activin receptor mrna in vitro and tested the effect of the injection of the mrna into xenopus fertilized eggs on subsequent development when the synthetic mrna was injected into uncleaved fertilized eggs embryos with reduced trunk structure were formed however when the mrna was injected into the ventral blastomeres at the 16-cell stage embryos with a secondary body axis were formed these results indicate the importance of the function of activin receptor in the regulatory mechanism for body axis formation"
E	"we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of gene pox2 which encodes one of the major peroxisomal polypeptides pxps of candida tropicalis pox2 is linked to gene pox4 which codes for a subunit pxp-4 of long-chain acyl-coa oxidase southern blot analysis revealed that pox2 had a significant homology to pox4 and also to gene pox5 which encodes a subunit pxp-5 of the isozyme of acyl-coa oxidase pxp-2 the protein product of pox2 was co-purified with pxp-4 from the isolated peroxisomes pxp-2 itself was a flavoprotein and likely to form an equimolar complex with pxp-4 although its enzymatic activity was uncertain pox2 corresponds to a single open reading frame of 724 amino acids and has no introns the n-terminal sequence and the calculated mr of the deduced polypeptide were consistent with those of isolated pxp-2 the primary structure was highly homologous to those of pxp-4 and pxp-5 in respect of the amino acid sequence and the hydropathy profile we conclude that pox2 is a third gene of the peroxisomal acyl-coa oxidase multigene family"
B	"thermus thermophilus hb8 cells grown under reduced dioxygen tensions contain a substantially increased amount of heme a much of which appears to be due to the presence of the terminal oxidase cytochrome ba3 we describe a purification procedure for this enzyme that yields approximately 100 mg of pure protein from 2 kg of wet mass of cells grown in 60 or  50 microm o2 examination of the protein by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with coomassie blue reveals one strongly staining band at approximately 35 kda and one very weakly staining band at approximately 18 kda as reported earlier zimmermann bh nitsche ci fee j a rusnak f and mnck e 1988 proc natl acad sci usa 85 5779-5783 by contrast treatment of the gels with agno3 reveals that the larger polypeptide stains quite weakly while the smaller polypeptide stains very strongly these results suggested the presence of two polypeptides in this protein using partial amino acid sequences from both proteins to obtain dna sequence information we isolated and sequenced a portion of the thermus chromosome containing the genes encoding the larger protein subunit i cbaa and the smaller protein subunit ii cbab the two polypeptides were isolated using reversed phase liquid chromatography and their mole percent amino acid compositions are consistent with the proposed translation of their respective genes the two genes appear to be part of a larger operon but we have not extended the sequencing to identify initiation and termination sequences the deduced amino acid sequence of subunit i includes the six canonical histidine residues involved in binding the low spin heme b and the binuclear center cubheme a these and other conserved amino acids are placed along the polypeptide among alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments in a pattern that shows clear homology to other members of the heme- and copper-requiring terminal oxidases the deduced amino acid sequence of the subunit ii contains the cua binding motif including two cysteines two histidines and a methionine but in contrast to most other subunits ii it has only one region of hydrophobic sequence near its n terminus alignment of these two polypeptides with other cytochrome c and quinol oxidases combined with secondary structure analysis and previous spectral studies clearly establish cytochrome ba3 as a bona fide member of the superfamily of heme- and copper-requiring oxidases the alignments further indicate that cytochrome ba3 is phylogenetically distant from other cytochrome c and quinol oxidases and they substantially decrease the number of conserved amino acid residues"

E	"the primary structure of the major quail liver alcohol dehydrogenase was determined it is a long-chain zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase of the type occurring also in mammals and hence allows judgement of the gene duplications giving rise to the classes of the human alcohol dehydrogenase system the avian form is most closely related to the class i mammalian enzyme 72-75 residue identity least related to class ii 60 identity and intermediately related to class iii 64-65 identity this pattern distinguishes the mammalian enzyme classes and separates classes i and ii in particular in addition to the generally larger similarities with class i the avian enzyme exhibits certain residue patterns otherwise typical of the other classes including an extra trp residue present in both class ii and iii but not in class i with a corresponding increase in the uv absorbance the avian enzyme further shows that a gly residue at position 260 previously considered strictly conserved in alcohol dehydrogenases can be exchanged with lys however zinc-binding residues coenzyme-binding residues and to a large extent substrate-binding residues are unchanged in the avian enzyme suggesting its functional properties to be related to those of the class i mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases in contrast the areas of subunit interactions in the dimers differ substantially these results show that a the vertebrate enzyme classes are of distant origin b the submammalian enzyme exhibits partly mixed properties in relation to the classes and c the three mammalian enzyme classes are not as equidistantly related as initially apparent but suggest origins from two sublevels"
E	"rate constancy of dna sequence evolution was examined for three species of drosophila using two samples the published sequences of eight genes from regions of the normal recombination rates and new data of the four as-c ac sc l'sc and ase and ci genes the as-c and ci genes were chosen because these genes are located in the regions of very reduced recombination in drosophila melanogaster and their locations remain unchanged throughout the entire lineages involved yielding less effect of ancestral polymorphism in the study of rate constancy the synonymous substitution pattern of the three lineages was found to be erratic in both samples the dispersion index for replacement substitution was relatively high for the per g6pd and ac genes a significant heterogeneity was found in the number of synonymous substitutions in the three lineages between the two samples of genes with different recombination rates this is partly due to a lack of the lineage effect in the d melanogaster and drosophila simulans lineages in the as-c and ci genes in contrast to akashi's observation of genes in regions of normal recombination the higher codon bias in drosophila yakuba as compared with d melanogaster and d simulans was observed in the four as-c genes which suggests changes in action of natural selection involved in codon usage on these genes fluctuating selection intensity may also be responsible for the observed locus-lineage interaction effects in synonymous substitution"

E	"fifteen unique chorion protein-encoding cdnas from gypsy moth have been completely sequenced these sequences are encoded by a family of genes based on pairwise similarity values of 78-100 within a 225-nt region pairwise comparisons and maximum parsimony analysis strongly support the existence of two clusters of 11 and four sequences each called noc1 and noc2 while noc2 consists of two subclusters there is little character support for subclusters within noc1 the highly localized character-state distribution on the parsimony tree in gypsy moth is reminiscent of that in bombyx mori specifically for those chorion families that have been shown to undergo gene conversion gene conversion thus becomes a reasonable explanation for the homogeneity of noc1 sequences and for their distinctness from noc2 the relationship between the two major clusters of chorion sequences in gypsy moth noc1 noc2 and bombyx mori bm alpha bm beta has been addressed through mixed-species tree construction all four groups cluster separately thus providing no direct evidence of orthologous sequences however the occurrence of gene conversion could have eliminated such evidence the relationship between the chorion gene tree and the species cladogenic event is discussed as are biases in codon usage base composition and nucleotide transformations"

E	"we have identified a previously uncharacterized gene that is implicated in the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue of mice this gene termed cig30 is the first mammalian member of a novel gene family comprising several nematode and yeast genes such as sur4 and fen1 mutation of which is associated with highly pleiotropic phenotypes it codes for a 30-kda plasma membrane glycoprotein with five putative transmembrane domains the cig30 mrna was readily detected only in brown fat and liver when animals were exposed to a 3-day cold stress the cig30 expression was selectively elevated in brown fat more than 200-fold similar increases were brought about in two other conditions of brown fat recruitment namely during perinatal development and after cafeteria diet the magnitude of cig30 mrna induction in the cold could be mimicked by chronic norepinephrine treatment in vivo however in primary cultures of brown adipocytes a synergistic action of norepinephrine and dexamethasone was required for full expression of the gene indicating that both catecholamines and glucocorticoids are required for the induction of cig30 we propose that the cig30 protein is involved in a pathway connected with brown fat hyperplasia"
B	"the extracellular secretion of the antibacterial toxin colicin v is mediated via a signal sequence independent process which requires the products of two linked genes cvaa and cvab the nucleotide sequence of cvab reveals that its product is a member of a subfamily of proteins involved in the export of diverse molecules found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes this group of proteins here referred to as the 'mdr-like' subfamily is characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic region followed by a highly conserved atp binding fold by constructing fusions between the structural gene for colicin v cvac and a gene for alkaline phosphatase phoa lacking its signal sequence it was determined that 39 codons in the n-terminus of cvac contained the structural information to allow cvac-phoa fusion proteins to be efficiently translocated across the plasma membrane of escherichia coli in a cvaacvab dependent fashion this result is consistent with the location of point mutations in the cvac gene which yielded export deficient colicin v the presence of the export signal at the n-terminus of cvac contrasts with the observed c-terminal location of the export signal for hemolysin which also utilizes an mdr-like protein for its secretion it was also found that the cvaa component of the colicin v export system shows amino acid sequence similarities with another component involved in hemolysin export hlyd the role of the second component in these systems and the possibility that other members of the mdr-like subfamily will also have corresponding second components are discussed a third component used in both colicin v and hemolysin extracellular secretion is the e coli host outer membrane protein tolc"

E	"we describe here two novel mouse and human dna polymerases one pol lambda has homology with dna polymerase beta while the other one pol mu is closer to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase however both have dna polymerase activity in vitro and share similar structural organization including a brct domain helix-loop-helix dna-binding motifs and polymerase x domain mrna expression of pol lambda is highest in testis and fetal liver while expression of pol mu is more lymphoid with highest expression both in thymus and tonsillar b cells an unusually large number of splice variants is observed for the pol mu gene most of which affect the polymerase domain expression of mrna of both polymerases is down-regulated upon treatment by dna damaging agents uv light gamma-rays or h2o2 this suggests that their biological function may differ from dna translesion synthesis for which several dna polymerase activities have been recently described possible functions are discussed"
B	"we have sequenced the genome of the intracellular symbiont buchnera aphidicola from the aphid baizongia pistacea this strain diverged 80-150 million years ago from the common ancestor of two previously sequenced buchnera strains here a field-collected nonclonal sample of insects was used as source material for laboratory procedures as a consequence the genome assembly unveiled intrapopulational variation consisting of approximately 1200 polymorphic sites comparison of the 618-kb kbp genome with the two other buchnera genomes revealed a nearly perfect gene-order conservation indicating that the onset of genomic stasis coincided closely with establishment of the symbiosis with aphids approximately 200 million years ago extensive genome reduction also predates the synchronous diversification of buchnera and its host but at a slower rate gene loss continues among the extant lineages a computational study of protein folding predicts that proteins in buchnera as well as proteins of other intracellular bacteria are generally characterized by smaller folding efficiency compared with proteins of free living bacteria these and other degenerative genomic features are discussed in light of compensatory processes and theoretical predictions on the long-term evolutionary fate of symbionts like buchnera"
E	"the phylogenetic position of the recently extinct marsupial 'wolf' or thylacine thylacinus cynocephalus has been a source of contention in mammalian systematics for nearly a century thylacines were endemic to australasia but possessed striking anatomical similarities to oligo-miocene borhyaenid marsupials of south america at issue has been whether these features are indicative of common ancestry or convergent adaptation to carnivory recent morphological studies have supported both conclusions although current marsupial classifications group thylacines with australian dasyuromorphians this putative clade is characterized by mostly primitive morphological features attempts to determine thylacine affinities with ancient protein and dna analyses have supported but not resolved a dasyuromorphian placement we report 1546 bp of mitochondrial dna sequence from cytochrome b and 12s rrna genes and 841 bp of nuclear protamine gene sequence from the thylacine and representatives of all or most other marsupial orders phylogenetic analysis of these sequences shows unambiguously that thylacines are members of dasyuromorphia and suggests a late oligocene or very early miocene divergence of familial lineages"

B	"helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region"
E	"sucl was originally identified as a dna sequence that at high copy number rescued schizosaccharomyces pombe strains carrying certain temperature-sensitive alleles of the cdc2 cell cycle control gene we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1083-base-pair sucl dna fragment and s1 mapped its 866-nucleotide rna transcript the protein-coding sequence of the gene is interrupted by two intervening sequences of 115 and 51 base pairs the predicted translational product of the gene is a protein of 13 kilodaltons a chromosomal gene disruption of sucl was constructed in a diploid s pombe strain germinating spores carrying a null allele of the gene were capable of very limited cell division following which many cells became highly elongated the sucl gene was also strongly overexpressed under the control of a heterologous s pombe promoter overexpression of sucl is not lethal but causes a division delay such that cells are approximately twice the normal length at division these data suggest that sucl encodes a protein which plays a direct role in the cell division cycle of s pombe"
E	"the primary structure of bovine skeletal muscle acylphosphatase was determined by performing the sequence analyses of the complete series of tryptic peptides the amino acid composition of the entire series of peptic peptides was used to reconstruct the sequence by the overlapping method the proposed structure is further confirmed by analogy with known amino acid sequences of acylphosphatase from skeletal muscle of other vertebrate species the length of the polypeptide chain is 98 residues identical to the length of the enzymes from other known mammalian species but different from that found in turkey the enzyme is nh2-acetylated and a comparison with the analogous molecular forms from other vertebrate species indicates that there are several long polypeptide stretches strictly conserved 93-97 identical position among mammals and about 80 between calf and turkey enzymes"
B	"the escherichia coli gene encoding one of the primosomal proteins protein i was cloned by the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a coding region for protein i of 537 base pairs preceded by a possible promoter sequence the gene is located adjacent to the dnac locus probably both being in a single operon the protein i gene was shown to be closely related to the dnat locus based on the following observations i a multicopy plasmid carrying only the protein i gene suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a dnat strain and restores the ability of the strain to carry out stable dna replication in the absence of protein synthesis ii an extract from a dnat strain does not support replication of the plasmid pbr322 in vitro addition of purified protein i restores its activity these results indicate that protein i is encoded by dnat and that it is essential for chromosomal dna replication and is involved in the induction of stable dna replication during the sos response"

B	"diacetyl is a by-product of pyruvate metabolism in lactococcus lactis where pyruvate is first converted to alpha-acetolactate which is slowly decarboxylated to diacetyl in the presence of oxygen l lactis usually converts alpha-acetolactate to acetoin enzymatically by alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase encoded by the aldb gene we took advantage of the fact that this enzyme also has a central role in the regulation of branched-chain amino acids to select spontaneous aldb mutants in an unbalanced concentration of leucine versus those of valine and isoleucine in the medium industrial dairy strains of l lactis subsp lactis biovar diacetylactis containing point mutations and deletions of aldb were isolated and characterized their growth in milk was not affected but they rapidly accumulated a large amount of alpha-acetolactate instead of acetoin from citrate in milk under aerated condition strains devoid of aldb produced about 10 times more diacetyl than did the parental strains"
B	"the nucleotide sequence of the bacillus subtilis flim gene has been determined this gene encodes a 38-kda protein that is homologous to the flim flagellar switch proteins of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium expression of this gene in che cells of e coli and b subtilis interferes with normal chemotaxis the nature of the chemotaxis defect is dependent upon the host used in b subtilis overproduction of flim generates mostly nonmotile cells those cells that are motile switch less frequently expression of b subtilis flim in e coli also generates nonmotile cells however those cells that are motile have a tumble bias the b subtilis flim gene cannot complement an e coli flim mutant a frameshift mutation was constructed in the flim gene and the mutation was transferred onto the b subtilis chromosome the mutant has a fla- phenotype this phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that the flim protein encodes a component of the flagellar switch in b subtilis additional characterization of the flim mutant suggests that the hag and mot loci are not expressed these loci are regulated by the sigd form of rna polymerase we also did not observe any methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in an in vivo methylation experiment the expression of these proteins is also dependent upon sigd it is possible that a functional basal body-hook complex may be required for the expression of sigd-regulated chemotaxis and motility genes"
A	"the gene encoding a catalase-peroxidase of archaeal origin the halophilic catalase-peroxidase from haloarcula marismortui was sequenced the primary structure proposed was confirmed by edman degradation and mass spectrometry analyses of proteolytic fragments of the purified protein the open reading frame in the gene corresponds to 731 amino acids and the calculated mass of the mature protein deleted of the n-terminal methionine is 8125365 da in reasonable agreement with the value of 81292 - 9 da previously measured by mass spectrometry southern and northern blot analyses showed that the protein is encoded by a single gene as a monocistronic transcript the protein sequence shows a high level of identity with bacterial catalase-peroxidases with strongly conserved regions around the heme binding histidines similarly to other soluble halophilic proteins it shows the excess of acidic residues that has been associated with solvation in halophilic adaptation"
E	"erythrokeratodermia variabilis ekv omim 133200 is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis with considerable intra- and interfamilial variability it has a disfiguring phenotype characterized by the independent occurrence of two morphologic features transient figurate red patches and localized or generalized hyperkeratosis both features can be triggered by external factors such as trauma to the skin after initial linkage to the rh locus on 1p ekv was mapped to an interval of 26 cm on 1p34-p35 and a candidate gene gja4 encoding the gap junction protein alpha-4 connexin 31 cx31 was excluded by sequence analysis evidence in mouse suggesting that the ekv region harbours a cluster of epidermally expressed connexin genes led us to characterize the human homologues of gjb3 encoding cx31 and gjb5 encoding cx311 gjb3 gjb5 and gja4 were localized to a 11-mb yac in the candidate interval we detected heterozygous missense mutations in gjb3 in four ekv families leading to substitution of a conserved glycine by charged residues g12r and g12d or change of a cysteine c86s these mutations are predicted to interfere with normal cx31 structure and function possibly due to a dominant inhibitory effect our results implicate cx31 in the pathogenesis of ekv and provide evidence that intercellular communication mediated by cx31 is crucial for epidermal differentiation and response to external factors"
E	"the strict orthology of mitochondrial mt coding sequences has promoted their use in phylogenetic analyses at different levels here we present the results of a mitogenomic study ie analysis based on the set of protein-coding genes from complete mt genomes of 60 mammalian species this number includes 11 new mt genomes the sampling comprises all but one of the traditional eutherian orders the previously unrepresented order dermoptera flying lemurs fell within primates as the sister group of anthropoidea making primates paraphyletic this relationship was strongly supported lipotyphla insectivores split into three distinct lineages erinaceomorpha tenrecomorpha and soricomorpha erinaceomorpha was the basal eutherian lineage sirenia dugong and macroscelidea elephant shrew fell within the african clade pholidota pangolin joined the cetferungulata as the sister group of carnivora the analyses identified monophyletic pinnipedia with otariidae sea lions fur seals and odobenidae walruses as sister groups to the exclusion of phocidae true seals"
E	"all attempts to identify ornithine decarboxylase in the human pathogen trypanosoma cruzi have failed the parasites have instead been assumed to depend on putrescine uptake and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase adometdc for their synthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine we have now identified the gene encoding adometdc in t cruzi by pcr cloning with degenerate primers corresponding to conserved amino acid sequences in adometdc proteins of other trypanosomatids the amplified dna fragment was used as a probe to isolate the complete adometdc gene from a t cruzi genomic library the adometdc gene was located on chromosomes with a size of approx 14 mbp and contained a coding region of 1110 bp specifying a sequence of 370 amino acid residues the protein showed a sequence identity of only 25 with human adometdc the major differences being additional amino acids present in the terminal regions of the t cruzi enzyme as expected a higher sequence identity 68-72 was found in comparison with trypanosomatid adometdcs when the coding region was expressed in escherichia coli the recombinant protein underwent autocatalytic cleavage generating a 33-34 kda alpha subunit and a 9 kda beta subunit the encoded protein catalysed the decarboxylation of adomet km 021 mm and was stimulated by putrescine but inhibited by the polyamines weakly by spermidine and strongly by spermine methylglyoxal-bisguanylhydrazone mgbg a potent inhibitor of human adometdc was a poor inhibitor of the t cruzi enzyme this differential sensitivity to mgbg suggests that the two enzymes are sufficiently different to warrant the search for compounds that might interfere with the progression of chagas' disease by selectively inhibiting t cruzi adometdc"
E	"chitin synthase activity was studied in yeast and hyphal forms of candida albicans ph-activity profiles showed that yeast and hyphae contain a protease-dependent activity that has an optimum at ph 68 in addition there is an activity that is not activated by proteolysis in vitro and which shows a peak at ph 80 this suggests there are two distinct chitin synthases in c albicans a gene for chitin synthase from c albicans chs1 was cloned by heterologous expression in a saccharomyces cerevisiae chs1 mutant proof that the cloned chitin synthase is a c albicans membrane-bound zymogen capable of chitin biosynthesis in vitro was based on several criteria i the chs1 gene complemented the s cerevisiae chs1 mutation and encoded enzymatic activity which was stimulated by partial proteolysis ii the enzyme catalyses incorporation of 14c-glcnac from the substrate udpu-14c-glcnac into alkali-insoluble chitin iii southern analysis showed hybridization of a c albicans chs1 probe only with c albicans dna and not with s cerevisiae dna iv ph profiles of the cloned enzyme showed an optimum at ph 68 this overlaps with the ph-activity profiles for chitin synthase measured in yeast and hyphal forms of c albicans thus chs1 encodes only part of the chitin synthase activity in c albicans a gene for a second chitin synthase in c albicans with a ph optimum at 80 is proposed dna sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 2328 nucleotides which predicts a polypeptide of mr 88281 with 776 amino acids the alignment of derived amino acid sequences revealed that the chs1 gene from c albicans canchs1 is homologous 37 amino acid identity to the chs1 gene from s cerevisiae sacchs1"
E	"several macrocyclic peptides  approximately 30 amino acids with diverse biological activities have been isolated from the rubiaceae and violaceae plant families over recent years we have significantly expanded the range of known macrocyclic peptides with the discovery of 16 novel peptides from extracts of viola hederaceae viola odorata and oldenlandia affinis the viola plants had not previously been examined for these peptides and thus represent novel species in which these unusual macrocyclic peptides are produced further we have determined the three-dimensional structure of one of these novel peptides cycloviolacin o1 using 1h nmr spectroscopy the structure consists of a distorted triple-stranded beta-sheet and a cystine-knot arrangement of the disulfide bonds this structure is similar to kalata b1 and circulin a the only two macrocyclic peptides for which a structure was available suggesting that despite the sequence variation throughout the peptides they form a family in which the overall fold is conserved we refer to these peptides as the cyclotide family and their embedded topology as the cyclic cystine knot cck motif the unique cyclic and knotted nature of these molecules makes them a fascinating example of topologically complex proteins examination of the sequences reveals they can be separated into two subfamilies one of which tends to contain a larger number of positively charged residues and has a bracelet-like circularization of the backbone the second subfamily contains a backbone twist due to a cis-pro peptide bond and may conceptually be regarded as a molecular moebius strip here we define the structural features of the two apparent subfamilies of the cck peptides which may be significant for the likely defense related role of these peptides within plants"
E	"published molecular phylogenetic studies of elapid snakes agree that the marine and australo-melanesian forms are collectively monophyletic recent studies however disagree on the relationships of the african american and asian forms to resolve the relationships of the african american and asian species to each other and to the marineaustralo-melanesian clade we sequenced the entire cytochrome b gene for 28 elapids 2 additional elapid sequences from genbank were also included this sample includes all african american and asian genera except for the rare african pseudohaje as well as a representative sample of marineaustralo-melanesian genera the data were analyzed by the methods of maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood both types of analyses yielded similar trees from which the following conclusions can be drawn 1 homoroselaps falls outside a clade formed by the remaining elapids 2 the remaining elapids are divisible into two broad sister clades the marineaustralo-melanesian species vs the african american and asian species 3 american coral snakes cluster with asian coral snakes and 4 the true cobra genus naja is probably not monophyletic as the result of excluding such genera as boulengerina and paranaja"

E	"conserved amino acid motifs are found in numerous expressed genes proteins and peptides with functional relationships may be identified using probes designed to hybridize with these motifs an oligonucleotide probe was prepared to match the sequence of the expected active region of a frog corticotropin-releasing factor-like peptide sauvagine and used to screen a sheep brain cdna library a novel 1331-bp cdna encoding a putative 328-residue protein with a theoretical mass of 36 kda was identified the presence of a strong signal sequence indicates that it is a secreted protein the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are characterized by several potential phosphorylation sites and binding motifs suggesting a role in intracellular signal transduction although the protein possesses a 7-residue sequence identical to that found in sauvagine its overall primary structure most closely resembles those of the alpha-carbonic anhydrases alpha-cas moreover the detection of the human and mouse orthologues in the est databases together with an evolutionary analysis indicates that the protein represents a new member of the alpha-ca gene family which we designate carbonic anhydrase-related protein xi ca-rp xi encoded by ca11 human and car11 mouse rat the human ca11 gene appears to be located between the secretor type alpha12-fucosyltransferase gene cluster fut1-fut2-fut2p and the d-site binding protein gene dbp on chromosome 19q133 despite potentially inactivating changes in the active-site residues ca-rp xi is evolving very slowly in mammals a property indicative of an important function which has also been observed in the two other acatalytic ca isoforms ca-rp viii and ca-rp x whose functions are unknown"
E	"nucleotide sequences of eight est-5a and est-5c genes corresponding to previously sequenced est-5b genes in drosophila pseudoobscura were determined to compare patterns of polymorphism and divergence among members of this small gene family the three esterase genes were also sequenced from d persimilis and d miranda for interspecific comparisons the data provide evidence that gene conversion between loci contributes to polymorphism and to the homogenization of the est5 genes for est-5b which encodes one of the most highly polymorphic proteins in drosophila 12 of the segregating amino acid variants appear to have been introduced via gene conversion from other members of the gene family interlocus gene conversion can also explain high sequence similarity especially at synonymous sites between est-5b and est-5a tests of neutrality using interspecific comparisons show that levels of polymorphism conform to neutral expectations at each est-5 locus however mcdonald-kreitman tests based on intraspecific gene comparisons indicate that positive selection on amino acids has accompanied est-5 gene duplication and divergence in d pseudoobscura"
E	"we have characterized two previously cloned genes f1 and f2 1 that code for elongation factor ef - 1 alpha of drosophila melanogaster genomic southern blot hybridization revealed that they are the only gene copies present we isolated cdna clones of both transcripts from embryonal and pupal stage of development that cover the entire transcription unit the 5' ends of both genes have been determined by primer extension and for f1 also by rna sequencing these start sites have been shown to be used consistently during development comparison of cdna and genomic sequences revealed that ef - 1 alphaf1 consists of two and ef - 1 alphaf2 of five exons the two described elongation factor genes exhibit several regions of strong sequence conservation when compared to five recently cloned eucaryotic elongation factors"

B	"the origin and evolution of photosynthesis have long remained enigmatic due to a lack of sequence information of photosynthesis genes across the entire photosynthetic domain to probe early evolutionary history of photosynthesis we obtained new sequence information of a number of photosynthesis genes from the green sulfur bacterium chlorobium tepidum and the green nonsulfur bacterium chloroflexus aurantiacus a total of 31 open reading frames that encode enzymes involved in bacteriochlorophyllporphyrin biosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthetic electron transfer were identified in about 100 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence phylogenetic analyses of multiple magnesium-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes using a combination of distance maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods indicate that heliobacteria are closest to the last common ancestor of all oxygenic photosynthetic lineages and that green sulfur bacteria and green nonsulfur bacteria are each other's closest relatives parsimony and distance analyses further identify purple bacteria as the earliest emerging photosynthetic lineage these results challenge previous conclusions based on 16s ribosomal rna and hsp60hsp70 analyses that green nonsulfur bacteria or heliobacteria are the earliest phototrophs the overall consensus of our phylogenetic analysis that bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis evolved before chlorophyll biosynthesis also argues against the long-held granick hypothesis"
E	"the cdna encoding the bovine activin type ii receptor has been cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr amplification of a bovine testicular rna preparation sequence comparisons of the bovine activin type ii receptor with its human mouse and rat homologues show strong evolutionary conservation at the nucleotide level of 949 935 929 and at the amino acid level of 986 990 988 respectively bovine activin type ii receptor mrna is widely but not strongly expressed in reproductive tissues with a major rna band at 6 kb and minor bands at 5 kb and 3 kb the differential levels of expression observed in these tissues suggest that levels of bactrii gene expression are regulated furthermore we have observed decreasing levels of the bovine activin type ii receptor mrna with testes maturation"

E	"the many different cellular functions so far shown to involve actin and to be regulated by specific actin binding proteins are located primarily if not exclusively in the cytoplasm actin is also found in the nucleus of various cells but because of the problems of cell fractionation the significance of nuclear actin has remained unclear the large amphibian oocyte nucleus germinal vesicle however can be isolated manually with little cytoplasmic contamination this nucleus contains high concentrations 4-6 mg ml-1 of mostly soluble although polymerization-competent beta- and gamma-actin which exists in a nucleocytoplasmic exchange pool the findings that drastic effects on transcription and chromosome morphology are caused by the injection of actin antibodies or actin binding proteins into germinal vesicles and that a factor required for accurate transcription by rna polymerase ii is actin suggest that nuclear actin is involved in specific nuclear functions we have recently identified two main components in xenopus laevis oocytes with actin binding activities one of these activities is ca2-dependent is located predominantly if not exclusively in the cytoplasm and is attributable to gelsolin here we report that the second component having a ca2-independent activity is a heterodimeric acting binding protein this protein is markedly enriched in the nuclei of oocytes and somatic cells of amphibia but also occurs in nuclei of other vertebrate cells"

E	"the primary structure of the gamma 1 subunit of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzyme gamma 1 gamma 1 was deduced by characterization of 36 tryptic and 2 cnbr peptides the polypeptide chain is composed of 373 amino acid residues gamma 1 differs from the beta 1 subunit of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase at 21 positions and from the e subunit of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase at 43 positions including a gap at position 128 as in the beta 1 subunit all zinc-liganding residues from the e subunit of the horse protein and the beta 1 subunit of the human enzyme are conserved but like beta 1 gamma 1 also has an additional cysteine residue at position 286 in the positional numbering system of the horse enzyme due to a tyr----cys exchange most amino acid exchanges preserve the properties of the residues affected and are largely located on the surface of the molecules away from the active site and the coenzyme binding region however eight positions with charge differences in relation to the e subunit of the horse enzyme are noticed these result in a net positive charge increase of one in gamma 1 versus e explaining the electrophoretic mobilities on starch gels of functional significance is the conservation of ser-48 in gamma 1 relative to e the residue is close to the active site but different thr-48 in the beta 1 subunit of the human enzyme thus the closer structural relationship between human gamma 1 and horse e enzyme subunit than between beta 1 and e is also reflected in functionally important residues explaining a greater similarity between gamma 1 gamma 1 and ee than between beta 1 beta 1 and ee"
B	"the nucleotide sequence of five genes from the major bacillus subtilis chemotaxis locus has been determined four of these genes encode proteins that are homologous to the salmonella typhimurium flgb flgc flgg and flif proteins one gene encodes a protein that is homologous to the escherichia coli flie protein the data from s typhimurium and e coli suggest that all of these proteins form part of the hook-basal body hbb complex of the bacterial flagella the flgb flgc and flgg proteins are components of the proximal and distal rods the flif protein forms the m-ring that anchors the rod assembly to the membrane the role of the flie protein within the hbb complex has not yet been determined the similarity between the b subtilis and s typhimurium proteins suggests that the structure of the m-ring and the rod may be similar in the two species however we observed some differences in size and amino acid composition between some of the corresponding homologues that suggest the basal body proteins may be organized slightly differently within b subtilis"

B	"pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances"
E	"sulfonylureas are a class of drugs commonly used in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus their therapeutic action results primarily from their ability to inhibit atp-sensitive potassium katp channels in the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta cells and thereby stimulate insulin release a key question is whether an endogenous ligand for the katp channel exists that is able to mimic the inhibitory effects of sulfonylureas we describe here the cloning of the cdna encoding human alpha-endosulfine a 13-kda peptide that is a putative candidate for such a role alpha-endosulfine is expressed in a wide range of tissues including muscle brain and endocrine tissues the recombinant protein displaces binding of the sulfonylurea 3hglibenclamide to beta cell membranes inhibits cloned katp channel currents and stimulates insulin secretion we propose that endosulfine is an endogenous regulator of the katp channel which has a key role in the control of insulin release and more generally couples cell metabolism to electrical activity"

B	"background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea"
E	"the proteolipid subunit of the mitochondrial atp synthase from neurospora crassa is an extremely hydrophobic protein of 81 amino acid residues which is imported into mitochondria as a precursor of mol wt 15 000 the primary structure of the imported form has now been determined by isolating and analyzing cdna clones of the preproteolipid mrna an initial cdna clone was identified by hybridizing total polyadenylated rna to pooled cdna recombinant plasmids from an ordered clone bank and subsequent cell-free translation of hybridization-selected mrna further preproteolipid clones were identified at a frequency of 02 by colony filter hybridization one isolated cdna represented the major part of the preproteolipid mrna the nucleotide sequence showed 243 bases corresponding to the mature proteolipid and in addition 178 bases coding for an amino-terminal presequence  non-coding sequences of 48 bases at the 5' end and of 358 bases at the 3' end plus a polya tail were determined the long presequence of 66 amino acids is very polar in contrast to the lipophilic mature proteolipid and includes 12 basic and no acidic side chains it is suggested that the presequence is specifically designed to solubilize the proteolipid for post-translational import into the mitochondria"

E	"development of the lymphoid system is dependent on the activity of zinc finger transcription factors encoded by the ikaros gene differences between the phenotypes resulting from a dominant-negative and a null mutation in this gene suggest that ikaros proteins act in concert with another factor with which they form heterodimers here we report the cloning of aiolos a gene which encodes an ikaros homologue that heterodimerizes with ikaros proteins in contrast to ikaros--which is expressed from the pluripotent stem cell to the mature lymphocyte--aiolos is first detected in more committed progenitors with a lymphoid potential and is strongly up-regulated as these differentiate into pre-t and pre-b cell precursors the expression patterns of aiolos and ikaros the relative transcriptional activity of their homo- and heteromeric complexes and the dominant interfering effect of mutant ikaros isoforms on aiolos activity all strongly suggest that aiolos acts in concert with ikaros during lymphocyte development we therefore propose that increasing levels of ikaros and aiolos homo- and heteromeric complexes in differentiating lymphocytes are essential for normal progression to a mature and immunocompetent state"

E	"genes encoding proteins homologous to the catalytic subunits of dna polymerase alpha and delta have been cloned from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum these are among the first cellular replicative dna polymerase genes to be cloned and their sequences allow us to make new statements about the relative degrees of conservation of these two enzymes the most important finding was that p falciparum pol delta showed considerable homology to the only other pol delta enzyme for which published sequence is available that of s cerevisiae displaying an overall amino acid identity of 45 and identity over a highly conserved central region of 59 in contrast the level of identity shown over the equivalent central region of pol alpha between the p falciparum and s cerevisiae sequences is only 32 the sequence data also allowed us to examine the degree of conservation in putative exonuclease domains of pol delta the pol delta gene of p falciparum maps to chromosome 10 and evidence is presented for the presence of different sized pol delta mrna's in the asexual and sexual erythrocytic stages of parasite development"
E	"a variety of stimuli have been identified which initiate transcription-dependent programmed cell death apoptosis in specific target cells since the withdrawal of androgens induces regression and apoptosis in rat ventral prostate rvp epithelial cells and it is known that the androgen receptor is a transcriptional regulator we used subtraction cdna cloning to isolate differentially expressed transcripts from the rvp of androgen ablated rats in addition to sulfated glycoprotein-2 and glutathione s-transferase gst which had been previously described several other transcripts were found to be elevated 3- to 8-fold in the regressing rvp dna sequencing revealed that two of these cdna clones encode matrix carboxyglutamic acid and gamma-actin respectively a third cdna contained novel sequence information and was named rvp1 the rvp1 transcript is expressed at very low levels in the rvp and epididymis of normal adult rats less than 001 of the total mrna and is undetectable in other tissues such as kidney liver and muscle rvp1 encodes a putative 280-amino acid protein which shares no significant homology with previously described protein functional domains we examined the expression of these transcripts in serum-starved nih 3t3 cells to determine whether any of them are elevated in cells that are growth arrested it was found that only gst mrna levels are increased under these conditions these data may suggest that induction of some genes such as rvp1 could be associated with apoptosis whereas other transcripts such as gst may be up-regulated in response to altered rates of cellular metabolism"

B	"the dlt operon of gram-positive bacteria comprises four genes dlta dltb dltc and dltd that catalyze the incorporation of d-alanine residues into the lipoteichoic acids ltas in this work we characterized the dlt operon of streptococcus agalactiae which in addition to the dlta to dltd genes included two regulatory genes designated dltr and dlts located upstream of dlta the dltr gene encodes a 224-amino-acid putative response regulator belonging to the ompr family of regulatory proteins the dlts gene codes for a 395-amino-acid putative histidine kinase thought to be involved in the sensing of environmental signals the dlt operon of s agalactiae is mainly transcribed from the pdltr promoter which directs synthesis of a 65-kb transcript encompassing dltr dlts dlta dltb dltc and dltd and from a weaker promoter pdlta which is located in the 3' extremity of dlts we demonstrate that pdltr but not pdla is activated by dltr in the presence of dlts in d-ala-deficient lta mutants resulting from insertional inactivation of the dlta gene which encodes the cytoplasmic d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier ligase dlta expression of the dlt operon does not require dltr and dlts since the basal activity of pdltr is high being 20-fold that of the constitutive promoter papha-3 which directs synthesis of the kanamycin resistance gene apha-3 in various gram-positive bacteria we hypothesize that the role of dltr and dlts in the control of expression of the dlt operon is to maintain the level of d-ala esters in ltas at a constant and appropriate value whatever the environmental conditions the dlta- mutant displayed the ability to form clumps in standing culture and exhibited an increased susceptibility to the cationic antimicrobial polypeptide colistin"

B	"the periodic and sequential expression of flagellar fla genes in the caulobacter crescentus cell cycle depends on their organization into levels i to iv of a regulatory hierarchy in which genes at the top of the hierarchy are expressed early in the cell cycle and are required for the later expression of genes below them in these studies we have examined the regulatory role of level ii flif operon which is located near the top of the hierarchy the last gene in the flif operon flbd encodes a transcriptional factor required for activation of sigma 54-dependent promoters at levels iii and iv and negative autoregulation of the level ii flif promoter we have physically mapped the flif operon identified four new genes in the transcription unit and determined that the organization of these genes is 5'-flif-flig-flbe-flin-flbd-3' three of the genes encode homologs of the ms ring protein flif and two switch proteins flig and flin of enteric bacteria and the fourth encodes a predicted protein flbe without obvious similarities to known bacterial proteins we have introduced nonpolar mutations in each of the open reading frames and shown that all of the newly identified genes flif flig flbe and flin are required in addition to flbd for activation of the sigma 54-dependent flgk and flbg promoters at level iii in contrast flif flig and flbe but not flin are required in addition to flbd for negative autoregulation of the level ii flif promoter the simplest interpretation of these results is that the requirements of flbd in transcriptional activation and repression are not identical and we speculate that flbd function is subject to dual or overlapping controls we also discuss the requirement of multiple structural genes for regulation of levels ii and iii genes and suggest that fla gene expression in c crescentus may be coupled to two checkpoints in flagellum assembly"

E	"two cdna clones for the alpha-subunit of rat liver electron transfer flavoprotein were isolated and their nucleotide sequences were determined the longer cdna contained a protein-coding region of 900 nucleotides and 3'-noncoding region of 335 nucleotides the identity of the clone was confirmed by matching the amino acid sequence predicted from the cdna with the sequence of one of the lysyl endopeptidase-digested peptides from the purified alpha-subunit the molecular weight of the protein calculated from the protein-coding nucleotides was approx 3000 daltons smaller than that of the precursor suggesting that the cdna was not of full length the derived amino acid composition fairly agreed with the chemically determined amino acid composition of the purified alpha-subunit indicating that the protein-coding region contains most of the mature alpha-subunit"
E	"we report here the reconstitution of a pathway that leads to the apoptotic changes in nuclei by using recombinant dna fragmentation factor dff a heterodimeric protein of 40 and 45 kda coexpression of dff40 and dff45 is required to generate recombinant dff which becomes activated when dff45 is cleaved by caspase-3 the cleaved fragments of dff45 dissociate from the dff40 the active component of dff purified dff40 exhibited an intrinsic dnase activity that was markedly stimulated by chromatin-associated proteins histone h1 and high mobility group proteins dff40 also triggered chromatin condensation when incubated with nuclei these data suggest that dff40 is sufficient to trigger both dna fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis"
E	"analysis of proteins registered in the pir protein database implied that most of relatively large proteins are related to important functions in higher multicellular organisms but not many large proteins have been registered to date to establish a protocol for efficient analysis of cdna clones coding for large proteins we constructed a series of strictly size-fractionated cdna libraries of human brain where the average insert sizes of cdna clones ranged from 33 kb to 10 kb as judged by hybridization analysis with probes derived from mrnas of known sizes the libraries with insert sizes up to 7 kb at least contained the clones corresponding to full-length transcripts in addition to truncated products of longer transcripts but few chimeric clones using one of the fractionated libraries with an average insert size of 7 kb the single-pass sequences from both the ends of randomly sampled clones were determined and sarched against dna databases approximately 90 of the clones were found to be new with respect to their 5'-sequences while their 3'-sequences were frequently similar to the registered expression sequence tags examination of the protein-coding capacity in an in vitro transcriptiontranslation system showed that about 20 of the clones direct the synthesis of proteins with apparent molecular masses larger than 50 kda the set of libraries constructed here should be very useful for the accumulation of sequence data on large proteins in the human brain"

B	"during flagellar morphogenesis in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli the flik gene product is responsible for hook length control a previous study m homma t iino and r m macnab j bacteriol 1702221-2228 1988 had suggested that the flik gene may generate two products we have confirmed that both proteins are products of the flik gene and have eliminated several possible explanations for the two forms we have determined the dna sequence of the flik gene in both bacterial species the deduced amino acid sequences of the wild-type flik proteins of s typhimurium and e coli correspond to molecular masses of 41748 and 39246 da respectively and are fairly hydrophilic alignment of the sequences gives an identity level of 50 which is low for homologous flagellar proteins from s typhimurium and e coli the c-terminal sequence is the most highly conserved part 71 identity in the last 154 amino acids the central and c-terminal regions are rich in proline and glutamine residues respectively linker insertion mutagenesis of the conserved c-terminal region completely abolished motility whereas disruption of the less conserved n-terminal and central regions had little or no effect we suggest that the n-terminal or n-terminal and central and c-terminal regions may constitute domains for several reasons we consider it unlikely that flik is functioning as a molecular ruler for determining hook length and conclude that it is probably employing a novel mechanism"

E	"a new mutant which was sensitive to both methyl-methanesulfonate mms and ultra-violet light uv and defective in meiotic recombination was isolated from saccharomyces cerevisiae the gene esr1 was cloned by complementation of the mms sensitivity of the mutant and found to be essential for cell growth as the deleted haploid strain was lethal the esr1 gene was adjacent to the cks1 gene on chromosome ii and encoded a putative 2368-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 273 k the esr1 transcript was 80 kb long and was induced during meiosis the predicted esr1 protein had a mosaic structure composed of homologous regions and showed amino acid sequence similarities to schizosaccharomyces pombe rad3 protein which monitors completion of dna repair synthesis and cut1 protein which is required for spindle pole body spb duplication the esr1 protein was also similar to phosphatidylinositol pi 3-kinases including saccharomyces cerevisiae tor2 and drr1 which are involved in g1 progression these results suggest that esr1 is multi-functional throughout mitosis and meiosis"
B	"almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte"
E	"a novel protein p55cdc has been identified in cycling mammalian cells this transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate the p55cdc protein appears to be essential for cell division since transfection of antisense p55cdc cdna into cho cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55cdc transcripts in the sense orientation immunoprecipitation of p55cdc yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle since p55cdc does not have the conserved protein kinase domains this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex the highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases the p55cdc protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells the amino acid sequence of p55cdc contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of g proteins and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc20 and cdc4 proteins which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells the g beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and in p55cdc may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase these findings suggest that p55cdc is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism"

E	"to obtain information about the evolution of the cholinesterases we investigated the cholinesterase activity of an agnathan vertebrate the hagfish myxine glutinosa on the basis of evidence from enzymology pharmacology and molecular biology we conclude that the cholinesterase activity is due to acetylcholinesterase ache the enzyme hydrolyzes acetylthiocholine preferentially and exhibits substrate inhibition the hydrolysis of both acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine are inhibited in parallel by cholinesterase inhibitors with the ache-specific drug bw284c51 being the most potent however this drug and propidium a peripheral anionic site ligand are much weaker inhibitors of the hagfish enzyme than of torpedo ache we used sequential extraction collagenase digestion and velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients to determine that the ache from the skeletal muscle of the hagfish is present in both globular and asymmetric forms we also used the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotide probes and genomic dna to obtain a 1 kb gene fragment for hagfish ache the enzyme has an acyl binding site typical of other vertebrate ache but lacks two aromatic residues implicated in the function of the peripheral anionic subsite we discuss the relevance of our findings to the evolution of the cholinesterases in the vertebrates"

E	"neuropeptide y npy plays an important role in the central regulation of neuronal activity endocrine and sexual behavior and food intake although transcription activity of the npy gene in pc12 cells is regulated by a number of agents such as nerve growth factor ngf the mechanism responsible for the ngf-elicited increase in the transcription of the npy gene remains to be explored in this study we isolated and characterized a nuclear protein that is bound to ngf-response elements ngfre that lie between nucleotide -87 and -33 of the rat npy promoter gene this nuclear protein is identical to the rat homolog of human transcription factor ap-2alpha we further demonstrated that rat ap-2a promotes efficient npy transcription activity in response to ngf finally we provide direct evidence that the mice lacking transcription factor ap-2alpha exhibit reduced expression of npy mrna compared with wild-type mice further supporting the hypothesis that ap-2alpha is an important transcription factor in regulating npy transcription activity"
E	"diverse proteins that are 35 to 55 identical to actins have been discovered recently in yeasts nematodes and vertebrates in order to study these proteins systematically and relate their functions to those of conventional actins we are isolating the corresponding genes from the genetically tractable eukaryote drosophila melanogaster here we report the isolation and partial characterization of a drosophila homologue of the schizosaccharomyces pombe act2 gene degenerate oligonucleotide primers specifying peptides that are highly conserved within the actin protein superfamily were used in conjunction with polymerase chain reaction pcr to amplify a portion of the drosophila gene that we have named actr66b the corresponding full-length cdna sequence encodes a protein of 418 residues that is 65 identical to the product of the s pombe act2 gene 80 identical to the bovine act2 homologue but only 48 identical to the principal drosophila cytoplasmic actin encoded by the act5c actin gene alignment of the yeast bovine and drosophila actin-related proteins shows that they have four peptide insertions relative to conventional actins three of which are well placed to modify actin polymerization and one that is likely to perturb the binding of myosin locations of two of the five actr66b introns are conserved between drosophila and yeast genes further attesting that they evolved from a common ancestor and are likely to encode proteins having similar functions we demonstrate that the drosophila gene is located on the left arm of chromosome 3 within subdivision 66b finally we show by rna blot-hybridization that the gene is expressed at low levels relative to conventional nonmuscle actin in all developmental stages from these and other observations we infer that the actr66b protein is a minor component of all cells perhaps serving to modify the polymerization structure and dynamic behavior of actin filaments"

E	"nucleotide sequence analysis of cdna clones for bovine elastin revealed the occurrence of three mrnas for elastin in fetal calf nuchal ligament encoding three forms of elastins a b and c of 747 733 and 713 amino acid residues respectively these forms arise as the result of the presence at a single position of 102 additional nucleotides in the mrna for elastin a and of 60 of these nucleotides in the mrna for elastin b as compared to the mrna for elastin c as expected most lysines occur in pairs separated by two or three small amino acid residues however at two places lysines occur in groups of three the occurrence of a group of three lysines followed by a hydrophobic residue lysine 400 404 and 407 offers an explanation for the formation of lysinonorleucine the alignment of amino acid sequences of porcine tropoelastin tryptic peptides with the sequence for bovine elastin a results in the ordering of these tryptic peptides the analysis of the complete primary structures of elastin a b and c provides further insight into the structure-function relations of elastin"
E	"the distribution of calsequestrin and calreticulin in smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues was investigated immunoblots of endoplasmic reticulum proteins probed with anti-calreticulin and anti-calsequestrin antibodies revealed that only calreticulin is present in the rat liver endoplasmic reticulum membrane fractions isolated from uterine smooth muscle which are enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum contain a protein band which is immunoreactive with anti-calreticulin but not with anti-calsequestrin antibodies the presence of calreticulin in these membrane fractions was further confirmed by 45ca2 overlay and stains-all techniques calreticulin was also localized to smooth muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum by the indirect immunofluorescence staining of smooth muscle cells with anti-calreticulin antibodies furthermore both liver and uterine smooth muscle were found to contain high levels of mrna encoding calreticulin whereas no mrna encoding calsequestrin was detected we have employed an ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by mono q fast protein liquid chromatography as a method by which calsequestrin and calreticulin can be isolated from whole tissue homogenates and by which they can be clearly resolved from one another even where present in the same tissue calreticulin was isolated from rabbit and bovine liver rabbit brain rabbit and porcine uterus and bovine pancreas and was identified by its amino-terminal amino acid sequence calsequestrin cannot be detected in preparations from whole liver tissue and only very small amounts of calsequestrin are detectable in ammonium sulfate extracts of uterine smooth muscle we conclude that calreticulin and not calsequestrin is a major ca2 binding protein in liver endoplasmic reticulum and in uterine smooth muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calsequestrin and calreticulin may perform parallel functions in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum"

E	"the dauer larva is an alternative larval stage in caenorhabditis elegans which allows animals to survive through periods of low food availability well-fed worms live for about three weeks but dauer larvae can live for at least two months without affecting post-dauer lifespan mutations in daf-2 and age-1 which produce a dauer constitutive daf-c phenotype and in clk-1 which are believed to slow metabolism markedly increase adult lifespan here we show that a ctl-1 mutation reduces adult lifespan in otherwise wild-type animals and eliminates the daf-c and clk-1-mediated extension of adult lifespan ctl-1 encodes an unusual cytosolic catalase a second gene ctl-2 encodes a peroxisomal catalase ctl-1 messenger rna is increased in dauer larvae and adults with the daf-c mutations we suggest that the ctl-1 catalase is needed during periods of starvation as in the dauer larva and that its misexpression in daf-c and clk-1 adults extends lifespan cytosolic catalase may have evolved to protect nematodes from oxidative damage produced during prolonged dormancy before reproductive maturity or it may represent a general mechanism for permitting organisms to cope with the metabolic changes that accompany starvation"
B	"here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen"

B	"we present a complete dna sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus the f nucleatum strain atcc 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ergo bioinformatics suite httpwwwintegratedgenomicscom the genome contains 217 mb encoding 2067 open reading frames organized on a single circular chromosome with 27 gc content despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive clostridium spp enterococcus spp and lactococcus spp the genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid amino acid carbohydrate and lipid metabolism nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence none of which has been reported in the literature more than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides sugars metal ions and cofactors have been identified biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids glutamate aspartate and asparagine the remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm a principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate additionally desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia h2s methyl mercaptan and butyrate which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium the metabolic capabilities of f nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth"
B	"we present the complete genome sequence of uropathogenic escherichia coli strain cft073 a three-way genome comparison of the cft073 enterohemorrhagic e coli edl933 and laboratory strain mg1655 reveals that amazingly only 392 of their combined nonredundant set of proteins actually are common to all three strains the pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain the difference in disease potential between o157h7 and cft073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type iii secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic e coli the cft073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins autotransporters iron-sequestration systems and phase-switch recombinases striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of cft073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic e coli strains j96 and 536 comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages the different e coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common vertically evolved genes whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain"
B	"both virulent and benign isolates of the ovine pathogen dichelobacter bacteroides nodosus produce polar fimbriae which have been implicated in twitching motility the fimbrial subunit-encoding genes from two virulent and two benign serogroup-b isolates of d nodosus were cloned and sequenced analysis of the deduced amino acid aa sequences of these subunits indicated the presence of substitutions that appeared to correlate with the virulence phenotype however these aa substitutions were located in variable regions of the protein where they are unlikely to alter the functional properties of the fimbriae the aa sequences of the serogroup-b subunits had a very high level 91-95 of similarity particularly at the n terminus where the conserved region extended up to aa 61 specific aa substitutions within the subunit of one isolate may reflect its serotypic variation from the other serogroup-b subunits studied"
E	"resistance to azole antifungal agents in candida albicans can be mediated by multidrug efflux transporters in a previous study we identified at least two such transporters cdr1p and benp which belong to the class of atp-binding cassette abc transporters and of major facilitators respectively to isolate additional factors potentially responsible for resistance to azole antifungal agents in c albicans the hypersusceptibility of a saccharomyces cerevisiae multidrug transporter mutant delta pdr5 to these agents was complemented with a c albicans genomic library several new genes were isolated one of which was a new abc transporter gene called cdr2 candida drug resistance the protein cdr2p encoded by this gene exhibited 84 identity with cdr1p and could confer resistance to azole antifungal agents to other antifungals terbinafine amorolfine and to a variety of metabolic inhibitors the disruption of cdr2 in the c albicans strain caf4-2 did not render cells more susceptible to these substances when the disruption of cdr2 was performed in the background of a mutant in which cdr1 was deleted the resulting double delta cdr1 delta cdr2 mutant was more susceptible to these agents than the single delta cdr1 mutant the absence of hypersusceptibility of the single delta cdr2 mutant could be explained by the absence of cdr2 mrna in azole-susceptible c albicans strains cdr2 was overexpressed however in clinical c albicans isolates resistant to azole antifungal agents as described previously for cdr1 but to levels exceeding or equal to those reached by cdr1 interestingly cdr2 expression was restored in delta cdr1 mutants reverting spontaneously to wild-type levels of susceptibility to azole antifungal agents these data demonstrate that cdr2 plays an important role in mediating the resistance of c albicans to azole antifungal agents"

B	"here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen"
E	"in petunia flowers the loci an1 an2 and an11 control the pigmentation of the flower by stimulating the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes the an1 and an2 locus were recently cloned and encode a basic helix-loop-helix bhlh and myb-domain transcriptional activator respectively here we report the isolation of the an11 locus by transposon tagging rna gel blot experiments show that an11 is expressed independently from an1 and an2 throughout plant development as well as in tissues that do not express the anthocyanin pathway it encodes a novel wd-repeat protein that is highly conserved even in species that do not produce anthocyanins such as yeast nematodes and mammals the observation that the human an11 homolog partially complements the an11 petunia mutant in transient assays shows that sequence similarity reflects functional conservation overexpression of an2 in an11- petals restored the activity of a structural anthocyanin gene in transient assays indicating that an11 acts upstream of an2 cell fractionation experiments show that the bulk of the an11 protein is localized in the cytoplasm taken together this indicates that an11 is a cytoplasmic component of a conserved signal transduction cascade that modulates an2 function in petunia thereby linking cellular signals with transcriptional activation"

E	"we describe a general assay designed to detect mutants of yeast that are defective for any of several aspects of telomere function using this assay we have isolated a mutant that displays a progressive decrease in telomere length as well as an increased frequency of chromosome loss this mutation defines a new gene designated est1 for ever shorter telomeres null alleles of est1 are not immediately inviable instead they have a senescence phenotype due to the gradual loss of sequences essential for telomere function leading to a progressive decrease in chromosomal stability and subsequent cell death"

E	"a novel protein p55cdc has been identified in cycling mammalian cells this transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate the p55cdc protein appears to be essential for cell division since transfection of antisense p55cdc cdna into cho cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55cdc transcripts in the sense orientation immunoprecipitation of p55cdc yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle since p55cdc does not have the conserved protein kinase domains this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex the highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases the p55cdc protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells the amino acid sequence of p55cdc contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of g proteins and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc20 and cdc4 proteins which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells the g beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and in p55cdc may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase these findings suggest that p55cdc is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism"
E	"proteinase inhibitors of the alpha 2-macroglobulin alpha 2m type although well characterized in vitro still evade a precise description of their actual role in vivo the main reason for this is the absence of any clinical evidence for the malfunctioning of alpha 2m in humans moreover despite their ubiquitous presence in animals of very different taxa animal models are notoriously absent in this field with the advent of transgenic animals an important tool became available in this respect as a first step in this direction we are analyzing at the molecular level all the members of this proteinase inhibitor family in the mouse to retrieve related sequences we screened a mouse liver cdna library with human alpha 2m cdna the sequences from two isolated clones partially coded for a protein with a high degree of sequence identity with human alpha 2m rat alpha 2m and rat alpha 1i3 protein sequence data from the large and small subunits of mouse alpha 2m and of the protein isolated from mouse plasma allowed us to designate the clones as coding for murinoglobulin mug an alpha 2m-related single-chain proteinase inhibitor rescreening resulted in the isolation of 24 clones of which 21 were related or identical to the original mug clones restriction analysis led to three groups of clones of which representative members were sequenced two highly homologous cdna sequences were derived coding for proteins that displayed the typical features of alpha 2m-type proteinase inhibitors the overall size the positions of a putative bait region and of the internal thiol ester and the positional conservation of cysteine residues and putative asparagine-glycosylation sites a third related member for which only one incomplete cdna clone was obtained and sequenced proved to be aberrant the bait region contained what appeared to be an intron which escaped proper splicing a second apparent intron was present at the 5' end of the cdna while a frameshift mutation near the 3' end insertion of a g caused premature termination of the reading frame when compared to the other mug sequences these features were confirmed from an isolated genomic clone and extended at the genomic level the corresponding gene a transcriptionally weakly active pseudogene contained the small intron but as part of a larger intron the presence of suitable intronexon splice sites show that a relatively small part of the intron is being introduced as an exon in the mrnaabstract truncated at 400 words"

V	"one of the striking molecular aspects of the human t-cell lymphotropic virus type iii htlv-iii now called hiv-1 is an unusually large variability in the env genes of different isolates these differences are clustered primarily within the coding sequences for the large envelope protein and are interspersed among regions within the env gene of relative constancy differences among the envelopes of isolates from africa are so far greater than those among us isolates but few us isolates have been characterized to date we report the sequence of the env gene of two us isolates htlv-iiimn and sc and compare them with previously characterized isolates these two isolates differ substantially from all previously described isolates especially in the region coding for the large envelope proteins the env genes of the two new hiv-1 isolates contain conserved and hypervariable regions similar to what has been reported for other isolates helping to further define those regions a comparison of the envelope sequences of all the us isolates shows that the similarity between any two ranges from 81 to 85 except for lavbru and htlv-iiibh10 which are 97 similar similar analyses of the african zairean isolates give significantly lower values 71 to 78 except for 88 between laveli and z6 this suggests that the african isolates diverged earlier than the us isolates or that transmission of the virus has been more rapid in africa two previous presumptive haitian isolates are similar to each other and to the us isolates to the same degree as are other us isolates but differ more markedly from the african isolates suggesting a common lineage of haitian and us hiv-1 isolates"

E	"gata transcription factors are important regulators of both hematopoiesis gata-123 and cardiogenesis gata-4 in mammals the transcriptional activities of the gata proteins are modulated by their interactions with other transcription factors and with transcriptional coactivators and repressors recently two related zinc finger proteins u-shaped ush and friend of gata-1 fog have been reported to interact with the gata proteins pannier and gata-1 respectively and to modulate their transcriptional activities in vitro and in vivo in this report we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a third fog-related protein fog-2 fog-2 is an 1151 amino acid nuclear protein that contains eight zinc finger motifs that are structurally related to those of both fog and ush fog-2 is first expressed in the mouse embryonic heart and septum transversum at embryonic day 85 and is subsequently expressed in the developing neuroepithelium and urogenital ridge in the adult fog-2 is expressed predominately in the heart brain and testis fog-2 associates physically with the n-terminal zinc finger of gata-4 both in vitro and in vivo this interaction appears to modulate specifically the transcriptional activity of gata-4 because overexpression of fog-2 in both nih 3t3 cells and primary rat cardiomyocytes represses gata-4-dependent transcription from multiple cardiac-restricted promoters taken together these results implicate fog-2 as a novel modulator of gata-4 function during cardiac development and suggest a paradigm in which tissue-specific interactions between different fog and gata proteins regulate the differentiation of distinct mesodermal cell lineages"

E	"from the analysis of restriction maps of the amy region in eight sibling species belonging to the drosophila melanogaster species subgroup we herein show that the patterns of duplication of the amy gene are almost the same in all species this indicates that duplication occurred before speciation within this species subgroup from the nucleotide sequence data we show a strong within-species similarity between the duplicated loci in the amy coding region this is in contrast to a strong similarity in the 5' and 3' flanking regions within each locus proximal or distal throughout the species subgroup this means that concerted evolution occurred only in the amy coding region and that differentiated evolution between the duplication occurred in the flanking regions moreover when comparing the species we also found a significant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in particular all the fixed substitutions specific to d erecta were found to be nonsynonymous we thus conclude that adaptive protein evolution occurred in the lineage of d erecta that is a specialist species for host plants and probably also occurs in the process of speciation in general"

A	"the archaeon methanosarcina mazei and related species are of great ecological importance as they are the only organisms fermenting acetate methylamines and methanol to methane carbon dioxide and ammonia in case of methylamines since acetate is the precursor of 60 of the methane produced on earth these organisms contribute significantly to the production of this greenhouse gas eg in rice paddies the 4096345 base pairs circular chromosome of m mazei is more than twice as large as the genomes of the methanogenic archaea currently completely sequenced bult et al 1996 smith et al 1997 3371 open reading frames orfs were identified based on currently available sequence data 376 of these orfs are methanosarcina-specific and 1043 orfs find their closest homologue in the bacterial domain 544 of these orfs reach significant similarity values only in the bacterial domain they include 56 of the 102 transposases and proteins involved in gluconeogenesis proline biosynthesis transport processes dna-repair environmental sensing gene regulation and stress response striking examples are the occurrence of the bacterial groelgroes chaperone system and the presence of tetrahydrofolate-dependent enzymes these findings might indicate that lateral gene transfer has played an important evolutionary role in forging the physiology of this metabolically versatile methanogen"

B	"yersinia enterocolitica is an enterobacterium responsible for gastrointestinal syndromes its pathogenicity depends on the presence of the 70-kb pyv plasmid which directs yop secretion the yop secretion machinery consisting of the ysca-u and lcrd proteins presents some structural similarity with the flagellum assembly machinery characterized in other bacteria flagellum assembly requires sigma 28 an alternative sigma factor the region upstream of the lcrd gene resembles promoters recognized by sigma 28 suggesting that the similarity between yop secretion and flagellum assembly could extend to their regulation the chromosome of y enterocolitica also contains pathogenicity determinants such as myfa which encodes the myf antigen subunit the promoter region of myfa also resembles promoters recognized by sigma 28 in an attempt to clarify the role of sigma 28 in the expression of lcrd myfa and flagellar genes we cloned sequenced and mutagenized the flia gene encoding the sigma 28 homolog in y enterocolitica as is the case in other bacteria flia was required for motility however it was involved neither in fibrilla synthesis nor in yop secretion the flia mutant allowed us to monitor the role of motility in pathogenesis at least in the mouse model motility seemed not to be required for y enterocolitica pathogenesis"
E	"homologues of the murine brachyury t gene have been cloned from several vertebrates and are implicated in mesoderm formation and in differentiation of the notochord in contrast the roles of the ascidian brachyury gene may be restricted to presumptive notochord to understand the evolution of brachyury genes and their developmental roles we have searched for homologues in amphioxus representing the third chordate subphylum and the probable closest relative of the vertebrates we report the isolation of two amphioxus cdna clones with clear homology to brachyury genes and demonstrate that these derive from separate loci resultant from a recent gene duplication this finding represents an exception to the emerging consensus of an archetypal prevertebrate genome in amphioxus the spatial and temporal distribution of brachyury transcripts during amphioxus development is remarkably similar to vertebrate brachyury in presumptive mesoderm posterior mesoderm and the notochord gene expression extends throughout the anteroposterior axis of the notochord despite the most rostral regions being a more recent specialization it also persists into larval stages despite differentiation into contractile tissue we propose that roles of brachyury in notochord differentiation are more ancient than roles in mesoderm formation and that the latter are shared by cephalochordates and all vertebrates"

E	"the actin-encoding genes scact1 and scact2 of the homobasidiomycete schizophyllum commune are the first actin genes isolated from higher filamentous fungi their isolation shows that homobasidiomycetes have two actin encoding genes instead of one typical to yeasts and filamentous ascomycetes this result was further confirmed by cloning two actin encoding genes sbact1 and sbact2 from another homobasidiomycete suillus bovinus the comparison of the genomic and cdna sequences of the actin genes showed that scact1 and scact2 genes of s commune contain seven introns five of which are at the same position in the two genes while s bovinus actin genes contain nine similarly positioned introns in the four genes five intron positions are shared which indicates a close relationship between the actin encoding genes from s commune and s bovinus northern hybridization and analysis of two-dimensional immunoblots showed a difference in the expression levels between the two actin genes in each fungus no actin protein could be detected from s commune scact2 the deduced amino acid sequence of the scact2 gene also differs considerably from any other known actin protein these data suggest that the scact2 gene either has a special as yet unidentified function in s commune life cycle or is a transcribed but no longer translated pseudogene scact2 gene has a putative microorf short open reading frame and scact1 gene an intron in the 5'-untranslated region which could reduce the translational efficiency and increase the transcriptional efficiency of the scact2 and scact1 genes respectively during mating in s commune or at formation of ectomycorrhiza in s bovinus the expression of actin genes was similar to that in vegetative hyphae this result suggests that the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in response to extra- and intracellular signals in higher filamentous fungi could be directly regulated by members of signalling pathways well characterized in yeast and mammalian cells"

B	"it has been suggested that rickettsia palindromic elements rpes have evolved as selfish dna that mediate protein sequence evolution by being targeted to genes that code for rna and proteins here we have examined the phylogenetic depth of two rpes that are located close to the genes encoding elongation factors tu tuf and g fus in rickettsia an exceptional organization of the elongation factor genes was found in all 11 species examined with complete or partial rpes identified downstream of the tuf gene rpe-tuf in six species and of the fus gene rpe-fus in 10 species a phylogenetic reconstruction shows that both rpe-tuf and rpe-fus have evolved in a manner that is consistent with the expected species divergence the analysis provides evidence for independent loss of rpe-tuf in several species possibly mediated by short repetitive sequences flanking the site of excision the remaining rpe-tuf sequences evolve as neutral sequences in different stages of deterioration likewise highly fragmented remnants of the rpe-fus sequence were identified in two species this suggests that genome-specific differences in the content of rpes are the result of recent loss rather than recent proliferation"
E	"we have identified a novel protein p22 required for constitutive exocytic membrane traffic p22 belongs to the ef-hand superfamily of ca2-binding proteins and shows extensive similarity to the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2b calcineurin b p22 is a cytosolic n-myristoylated protein that undergoes conformational changes upon binding of ca2 antibodies against a p22 peptide block the targetingfusion of transcytotic vesicles with the apical plasma membrane but recombinant wild-type p22 overcomes that inhibition nonmyristoylated p22 or p22 incapable of undergoing ca2-induced conformational changes cannot reverse the antibody-mediated inhibition the data suggest that p22 may act by transducing cellular ca2 signals to downstream effectors p22 is ubiquitously expressed and we propose that its function is required for membrane trafficking events common to many cells"

B	"the csmb gene encoding the 75-kda gerola-olson protein of chlorosomes has been cloned and sequenced from the green sulfur bacteria chlorobium vibrioforme strain 8327d and chlorobium tepidum two potential start codons were identified and the csmb gene may be translated into a preprotein with an amino-terminal extension two forms of the mature csmb protein 74 or 75 amino acids in length were identified that differ by the presence or absence of a methionine residue at the amino terminus the csmb gene of chl tepidum is transcribed as an abundant monocistronic mrna of approximately 350 nucleotides primer extension mapping of the 5' endpoint of the csmb mrna suggests there is strong similarity between the csmb promoter and the sigma70 promoters of escherichia coli the csmb protein of chl tepidum was overproduced as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in e coli purified to homogeneity by ni2 chelation affinity chromatography and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits protease susceptibility mapping and agglutination experiments with isolated chlorosomes using anti-csmb antibodies indicate that the csmb protein is a component of the chlorosome envelope"

E	"using different dna probes from the first two previously described alkane-inducible cytochrome p450 genes of the candida tropicalis cyp52 gene family we isolated five independent additional members by screening a genomic library under low-stringency conditions these genes are not allelic variants and when taken gogether constitute the largest gene family known in this organism the seven members of this gene family are located on four different chromosomes and four of them are tandemly arranged on the c tropicalis genome the products of the seven genes alk1 to alk7 were compared to each other and revealed a high degree of divergence the two most diverged proteins exhibit a sequence identity of only 32 six of the seven genes were shown to be induced by a variety of different aliphatic carbon sources but repressed when the organism was grown on glucose three of the five additional cyp52 genes could be successfully expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and display different substrate specificities in in vitro assays with model substrates alk2 and alk3 exhibit a strong preference for hexadecane while alk4 and alk5 preferentially hydroxylate lauric acid"
B	"the bacillus subtilis genome encodes two multidrug efflux transporters sharing 51 sequence identity bmr described previously and blt described here overexpression of either transporter in b subtilis leads to a similar increase in resistance to ethidium bromide rhodamine and acridine dyes tetraphenylphosphonium doxorubicin and fluoroquinolone antibiotics however blt differs widely from bmr in its expression pattern under standard cultivation conditions b subtilis expresses bmr but blt expression is undetectable we have previously shown that bmr expression is regulated by bmrr a member of the family of merr-like transcriptional activators here we show that blt transcription is regulated by another member of the same family bltr the dna-binding domains of bmrr and bltr are related but their putative inducer-binding domains are dissimilar suggesting that bmr and blt are expressed in response to different inducers indeed rhodamine a substrate of bmr and blt and a known inducer of bmr expression does not induce blt expression blt expression has been observed only in b subtilis carrying mutation acfa which as we show here alters the sequence of the blt gene promoter unlike bmr which is transcribed as a monocistronic mrna blt is cotranscribed with a downstream gene encoding a putative acetyltransferase overall the differences in transcriptional control and operon organization between bmr and blt suggest that the transporters encoded by these genes have independent functions involving the transport of distinct physiological compounds"
E	"the genome of the lower eukaryote dictyostelium discoideum comprises six chromosomes here we report the sequence of the largest chromosome 2 which at 8 megabases mb represents about 25 of the genome despite an a  t content of nearly 80 the chromosome codes for 2799 predicted protein coding genes and 73 transfer rna genes this gene density about 1 gene per 26 kilobases kb is surpassed only by saccharomyces cerevisiae one per 2 kb and is similar to that of schizosaccharomyces pombe one per 25 kb if we assume that the other chromosomes have a similar gene density we can expect around 11000 genes in the d discoideum genome a significant number of the genes show higher similarities to genes of vertebrates than to those of other fully sequenced eukaryotes this analysis strengthens the view that the evolutionary position of d discoideum is located before the branching of metazoa and fungi but after the divergence of the plant kingdom placing it close to the base of metazoan evolution"
E	"in previous studies we found that the ascorbic acid asa deficiency caused changes in the amounts of the various forms of cytochrome p450 p450 in liver microsomes from guinea pigs in a form-specific manner thus the aim of this study was to clarify whether the changes seen in the protein contents of the various forms of p450 were associated with the levels of the expression of their mrnas prior to determining the mrna level we isolated four cdna clones encoding cyp1a2 cyp3a14 cyp3a15 and cyp3a17 from guinea pig liver cdna libraries to use them as probes in further experiments the amino acid sequence of the guinea pig cyp1a2 showed identity ranging from 73 to 77 with those of other mammalian p450s the amino acid sequences among guinea pig cyp3as had about 94 identities with each other the asa deficiency apparently decreased the expression of mrna for cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 these results were in agreement with the decrease in the content of cyp1a1 and cyp1a2 proteins the amount of p450 proteins immunochemically cross-reactive with antibodies to human cyp3a4 was likely unaffected while that of human cyp3a7 tended to be decreased by the asa deficiency it suggested that the expression of each cyp3a isozyme was regulated differently by asa in fact the level of mrna for cyp3a14 was unaffected by the asa deficiency while those for cyp3a15 and cyp3a17 were significantly decreased by the asa deficiency clearly indicating that the expression of each isozyme within the cyp3a subfamily is differently regulated by asa these results support the idea that the transcription of p450 is regulated by asa in guinea pigs"

V	"the nucleotide sequence of t4 genes 55 alpha gt 47 and 46 was determined by a combination of 'classical' procedures and a shotgun approach small dna fragments generated by frequent cleavage with restriction enzymes or by sonication of restriction fragments were cloned in phage m13 vectors and sequenced by the dideoxy method the positions of the genes were determined by marker rescue between the corresponding t4 amber mutants and the cloned t4 dna fragments used in the sequencing experiments the sequence gives an insight into the organization of this 71-kb early region of the t4 genome and shows that genetically 'silent' portions within this region are not void of genetic information"
E	"the ahr locus encodes for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr which plays an important toxicological and developmental role sequence variation in this gene was studied in 13 different mouse lines that included eight laboratory strains two mus musculus subspecies and three additional mus species the data presented represent the largest study of sequence variation across multiple mouse lines in a single gene approximately equal to 159 kbmouse line among all mice the average frequency of all polymorphisms in the intronic regions was 203 variantskb and the average exonic frequency was 141 variantskb for substitutions alone the average frequencies in the intronic and exonic regions for all mice were 133 and 89 substitutionskb respectively between laboratory strains the average intronic and exonic frequencies for all polymorphisms dropped to 54 and 29 variantskb respectively there were 111 non-synonymous polymorphisms that resulted in 42 different amino acid changes of which only 10 amino acid changes had been previously identified based on the nucleotide sequence the phylogenetic history of the gene showed mice from the ahrb2 and ahrd alleles in separate branches while mice from the ahrb1 and ahrb3 alleles exhibited a more complex history evolutionarily the ahr protein as a whole appears to be under purifying selective pressure ka  ks ratio  0237 despite significant functional constraint in the basic helix-loop-helix and pas domains ligand binding is not constrained to the high-affinity allele which supports further the role of the ahr in development and its importance beyond the adaptive response to environmental toxicants"
E	"the subunit analogous to the d-subunit of atp synthase from bovine heart mitochondria was isolated from the purified yeast enzyme partial protein sequences were determined by direct methods from this information two oligonucleotide probes were constructed and used for screening a dna genomic bank of saccharomyces cerevisiae the sequence of yeast subunit d was deduced from the dna sequence of atp7 gene mature yeast subunit d is 173 amino acids long its nh2-terminal serine is blocked by an n-acetyl group and the protein has no processed nh2-terminal sequence other than the removal of the initiator methionine the protein is predominantly hydrophilic the amino acid sequence is 22 identical and 44 homologous to bovine subunit d a null mutant was constructed the mutant strain was unable to grow on glycerol medium the mutant mitochondria had no detectable oligomycin-sensitive atpase activity and the catalytic sector f1 was loosely bound to the membranous part the mutant mitochondria did not contain subunit d and the mitochondrially encoded hydrophobic subunit 6 was not present"

E	"heat shock protein 70 kda hsp70 family molecular chaperones play critical roles in protein folding and trafficking in all eukaryotic cells the mechanisms by which hsp70 family chaperones are regulated however are only partly understood bag-1 binds the atpase domains of hsp70 and hsc70 modulating their chaperone activity and functioning as a competitive antagonist of the co-chaperone hip we describe the identification of a family of bag-1-related proteins from humans bag-2 bag-3 bag-4 bag-5 the invertebrate caenorhabditis elegans bag-1 bag-2 and the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe bag-1a bag-1b these proteins all contain a conserved approximately 45-amino acid region near their c termini the bag domain that binds hsc70hsp70 but they differ widely in their n-terminal domains the human bag-1 bag-2 and bag-3 proteins bind with high affinity kd congruent with 1-10 nm to the atpase domain of hsc70 and inhibit its chaperone activity in a hip-repressible manner the findings suggest opportunities for specification and diversification of hsp70hsc70 chaperone functions through interactions with various bag-family proteins"
E	"we have accumulated information of the coding sequences of uncharacterized human genes which are known as kiaa genes and the number of these genes exceeds 2000 at present as an extension of this sequencing project we recently have begun to accumulate mouse kiaa-homologous cdnas because it would be useful to prepare a set of human and mouse homologous cdna pairs for further functional analysis of the kiaa genes we herein present the entire sequences of 400 mouse kiaa cdna clones and 4 novel cdna clones which were incidentally identified during this project most of clones entirely sequenced in this study were selected by computer-assisted analysis of terminal sequences of the cdnas the average size of the 404 cdna sequences reached 53 kb and that of the deduced amino acid sequences from these cdnas was 868 amino acid residues the results of sequence analyses of these clones showed that single mouse kiaa cdnas bridged two different human kiaa cdnas in some cases which indicated that these two human kiaa cdnas were derived from single genes although they had been supposed to originate from different genes furthermore we successfully mapped all the mouse kiaa cdnas along the genome using a recently published mouse genome draft sequence"
B	"a gene potentially encoding a subunit of the soluble hydrogenase of anabaena cylindrica was isolated from a genomic library by screening with a set of redundant oligonucleotides the sequence of which was deduced from the amino acid sequence of the purified hydrogenase subunit that catalyses tritium exchange the nucleotide sequence of the potential gene was determined from two overlapping dna fragments spanning 7237 bp of the a cylindrica genome the region sequenced contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 383 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41108 da the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme determined by edman degradation corresponds exactly with that deduced from the nucleic acid sequence no significant amino acid or nucleotide similarity is evident between this gene and the periplasmic hydrogenases from three species of desulfovibrio d vulgaris d baculatus and d gigas or with the membrane-bound 'uptake' hydrogenases of bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhodobacter capsulatus this suggests that the soluble enzyme from cyanobacteria represents a discrete class of hydrogenase the gene encoding the second subunit m  50 kda of the soluble hydrogenase which is required for the catalysis of hydrogen production from dithionite-reduced methyl viologen ewart g d 38 smith g d 1989 arch biochem biophys 268 327-337 apparently comprises a separate transcription unit since it appears not to be located adjacent to that for the 42-kda subunit"
B	"we have recently cloned and characterized the hemoglobin hb receptor gene hmbr from neisseria meningitidis to identify additional proteins that are involved in hb utilization the n meningitidis hb utilization system was reconstituted in escherichia coli five cosmids from n meningitidis dna library enabled a heme-requiring hema hmbr-expressing mutant of e coli to use hb as both porphyrin and iron source nucleotide sequence analysis of dna fragments subcloned from the hb-complementing cosmids identified four open reading frames three of them homologous to pseudomonas putida e coli and haemophilus influenzae exbb exbd and tonb genes the n meningitidis tonb protein is 288 to 336 identical to other gram-negative tonb proteins while the n meningitidis exbd protein shares between 233 and 343 identical amino acids with other exbd and tolr proteins the n meningitidis exbb protein was 247 to 361 homologous with other gram-negative exbb and tolq proteins complementation studies indicated that the neisserial ton system cannot interact with the e coli fhua tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor the n meningitidis tonb mutant was unable to use hb hb-haptoglobin complexes transferrin and lactoferrin as iron sources insertion of an antibiotic cassette in the 3' end of the exbd gene produced a leaky phenotype efficient usage of heme by n meningitidis tonb and exbd mutants suggests the existence of a ton-independent heme utilization mechanism e coli complementation studies and the analysis of n meningitidis hmbr and hpu mutants suggested the existence of another hb utilization mechanism in this organism"
E	"down syndrome is the most common birth defect which is caused by trisomy 21 we identified a novel gene in the so-called down syndrome critical region by est mapping to genomic dna and following cdna cloning the gene designated dcrb down syndrome critical region gene b consisted of three exons of 1095 bp in total and encoded a large open reading frame of 118 amino acid residues the amino acids sequence of dcrb showed no significant homology to any known protein northern blot analysis showed that dcrb is mainly expressed in the placenta in which a major 11-kb band and a minor 20-kb band were detected minor bands of 14 kb and 22 kb were also detected in adult heart and skeletal muscle"

E	"variation in rates of molecular evolution now appears to be widespread the demonstration that body size is correlated with rates of molecular evolution suggests that physiological and ecological factors may be involved in molecular rate variation but large-scale comparative studies are still lacking here we use complete cytochrome b sequences from 85 species of tube-nosed seabirds order procellariiformes and 5 outgroup species of penguins order sphenisciformes to test for an association between body mass and rates of molecular evolution within the former avian order cladistic analysis of the 90 sequences estimates a phylogeny largely consistent with the traditional taxonomy of the procellariiformes the diomedeidae procellariidae and pelecanoididae are monophyletic while the hydrobatidae are basal and paraphyletic however the two subfamilies within the hydrobatidae hydrobatinae and oceanitinae are monophyletic a likelihood ratio test detects significant deviation from clocklike evolution in our data using a sign test for an association between body mass and branch length in the seabird phylogeny we find that larger taxa tend to have shorter terminal branch lengths than smaller taxa this observation suggests that rates of mitochondrial dna evolution are slower for larger taxa rate calibrations based on the fossil record reveal concordant body size effects we interpret these results as evidence for a metabolic rate effect as the species in this order exhibit large differences in metabolic rates which are known to be highly correlated with body mass in this group our results support previous findings of body size effects and show that this effect can be significant even within a single avian order this suggests that even lineage-specific molecular clocks may not be tenable if calibrations involve taxa with different metabolic rates"
B	"the marine unicellular cyanobacterium prochlorococcus is the smallest-known oxygen-evolving autotroph it numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis here we compare the genomes of two prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the prochlorococcus lineage and that have different minimum maximum and optimal light intensities for growth the high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome 1657990 base pairs 1716 genes of any known oxygenic phototroph whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger at 2410873 base pairs 2275 genes the comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures although the two strains have 1350 genes in common a significant number are not shared and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans"

E	"the primary sequences of the chloroplast triose phosphatephosphate translocator precursor proteins from c4-plants maize mesophyll cells and flaveria trinervia and from the c3-type flaveria pringlei were determined the mature parts of these translocators possess 83-94 identical amino acid residues the c4-translocator protein can be correctly targeted to c3-type chloroplasts and inserted into the envelope membrane expression of the mature parts of these chloroplast translocators ctpt in transformed yeast cells and subsequent reconstitution of the functional proteins reveals the difference between the recombinant translocator proteins from the two cell types with respect to the transport of phosphoenolpyruvate comparison of the ctpt sequences from f pringlei and f trinervia in combination with computer-aided molecular modelling of the substrate translocation pore leads to the suggestion that only minor exchanges of amino acid residues between the c3- and c4-translocator proteins are sufficient to extend their substrate specificities to recognize also phosphoenolpyruvate"
E	"from our current understanding of the genetic basis of development and pattern formation in drosophila and vertebrates it is commonly thought that clusters of hox genes sculpt the morphology of animals in specific body regions based on hox gene conservation throughout the animal kingdom it is proposed that these genes and their role in pattern formation evolved early during the evolution of metazoans knowledge of the history of hox genes will lead to a better understanding of the role of hox genes in the evolution of animal body plans to infer hox gene evolution reliable data on lower chordates and invertebrates are crucial among the lower triploblasts the body plan of the ribbonworm lineus nemertini appears to be close to the common ancestral condition of protostomes and deuterostomes in this paper we present the isolation and identification of hox genes in lineus sanguineus we find that the lineus genome contains a single cluster of at least six hox genes two anterior-class genes three middle-class genes and one posterior-class gene each of the genes can be definitely assigned to an ortholog group on the basis of its homeobox and its flanking sequences the most closely related homeodomain sequences are invariably found among the mouse or amphioxus orthologs rather than drosophila and other invertebrates this suggests that the ribbonworms have diverged relatively little from the last common ancestors of protostomes and deuterostomes the urbilateria"
